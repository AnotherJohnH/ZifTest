As the security guard waves you through, you linger for a moment to absorb the 
historic nostalgia of your surroundings... 

Paramount Studios. 

You can almost feel the ghosts of Gary Cooper and Cecil B. Demille brush past 
as you clutch your knapsack close to your heart. Inside the tattered little 
sack is the culmination of two years work: a seven part mini-series you've 
written on the life of former vice-President Walter Mondale, entitled Fritz, We 
Hardly Knew Ye. Beaming with pride since the completion of your epic, you've 
had your sales pitch memorized and well-honed for weeks now; certain of success 
once you finagled an appointment with that legendary television producer, 
Irving M. Sowritch. A quick glance at your appointment slip affirms your timing 
is perfect. In a few minutes you'll have him eating out of your hand.

An avid devotee of film history, you've read a great deal about this grand old 
piece of real estate. You feel as if you know it well. Looking around, you 
begin to imagine which of these historical offices you'll soon be calling your 
own. But you quickly shake off the seductive daydream, intent on remembering 
the security guard's directions: northeast to the Administration building, then 
straight ahead until you're outside Sowritch's office.

Melrose Gate
This is the grand entrance to the studio lot. For almost a hundred years the 
famous arches to the south have been the portal beneath which Hollywood's 
greatest stars have passed on their way to silver screen immortality. A 
pleasant walkway heads west, while the studio's main administration building 
can be seen off to the northeast.

"Aye.  There's treasure to be found in those woods," came the words floating 
across the noisy pub like a magic incantation.

There! At two-o'clock.  A crusty old codger, bent toward his equally old and 
craggy companion.  The second man nods his head at every word the first one 
says.

"Yessir, if I were thirty years younger," the old man continues, "I'd go after 
it meself.  But this treasure...this treasure's for a younger man.  One oo's 
still got 'is strength 'n' wits about 'im - but one that ain't afraid o' dyin' 
neither.  'Cause that's what'll be waitin' for 'im, most likely. Least if 'e's 
not clever enough." 

The old man leans back, and then continues, "Yeah.  It's the Demon all right.  
'As to be.  Yessir.  When I was young, my daddy tolt me stories 'bout that 
Demon.  Stories that would curl my socks, I tell ya!  Yeah. 'Long time ago this 
all 'appened a'fore. Same Demon, too, I bet.  Mean, nasty thing. "Caused a lot

tooth for loot. Yessir.  Must 'ave some kind o' secret cave or 'ideout to keep 
it in.  Probly in them woods. 

"Yeah, if I were a younger man I'd be lookin'.  But I ain't got that many years 
left nomore and the few I got, I wants to keep.  Yessir, this one 'll 'ave to 
go to some youngster, if e's lucky."

Inside the Hut

Two days later, in a small, abandoned hut between Borphee and Pheebor...

It was good fortune to find this abandoned hut.  Secluded, yet not far from 
Borphee or Pheebor, it is a perfect site for your new base of operations.

The warm air inside is a bit stifling, while creaking sounds from the bamboo 
construction suggest that it is not entirely stable.

The only exit, an open doorway, is south.

You can also see a cot and a table (on which are some maps and a lantern) here.

August, 1876

"Men!" you snap at no one in particular as you hurry down the sidewalk. Up 
ahead you see Mrs. Jenkins take one look at you and head to the opposite side 
of the street, while Mr. Tutman and Mr. Lester look up from their checker game 
in front of the barber's shop and chuckle.

"Poor Sean..." you hear one of them say as you hurry on by. Poor Sean, indeed. 
They have no idea.

In your mind, you can still hear the investor's patronizing voices. "While we 
are sure you are quite capable, Miss Kelley," one had chuckled, "we really must 
speak with your uncle about financial matters such as these. You do 
understand."

Understand? Oh yes, you understand all too well. Never mind that it's your 
money, that you're the one who's really in charge of the business, handling the 
ordering, the hiring, keeping things running as smoothly as when your father 
held the reins. No, none of that matters. When it comes to talking money, a 
woman's place is... elsewhere. Men.

You stomp up the stairs of your uncle's favorite club, thrust open the outer 
door and step inside, already rehearsing today's lecture on promptness. The way 
things are shaping up, you can tell it's going to be a good one.

Lucky Strike Lobby
Dark stained oak paneling with well-polished brass knobs and rails attempt to 
give this smoky room a dignity it doesn't deserve. Rich detailing aside, this 
is the doorstep to depravity, and the less time you spend here, the better. For 
those who think otherwise, there is a plush red sofa against the far wall, 
positioned directly under a life sized painting of Ulysses S. Grant. To the 
south is an oak door leading outside. To the north is a glass door leading to 
the main room.

Good, the lobby is empty. Moving quickly, you cross the polished oak floor 
toward the inner sanctum door, praying that this time you can extract your 
uncle without making a scene.

"May I help you?" comes Simon's voice from the shadows. Rats. Just once today, 
couldn't something go your way? The doorman tosses a hat and coat on the sofa 
then hurries over, stationing himself in front of the glass door. "I'm sorry 
Miss Amelia, but you know the rules. Gentlemen only."

Some people love exploring caves, and some people get a sick thrill out of 
falling. But you're not one of them.

Since childhood you've had a fear of heights, depths, and quick trips in 
between; those dreams about endless drops into bottomless pits still haunt you, 
especially when you've had a bit to drink. You were also one of those kids who 
was CONVINCED that the boogeyman lurked under the basement steps, down there in 
the cold and clammy darkness. Nope, you are definitely NOT a fan of these two 
exotic pleasures of falling and darkness, which is why you're not thrilled 
about being thrown into a deep, forbidding shaft. If the fall lasts long enough 
maybe you'll get a chance to ponder what's at the bottom of it all, and what 
you left behind on the surface...

Press any key to continue > q

To be fair you HAVE plumbed these depths, though not in a very heroic way. 
You've done research and talked to people, mainly. When you devoted last week's 
editorial to exposing the shady dealings of New Jersey public officials, you 
thought you'd be given a promotion. Maybe the newspaper chain would bump you up 
to some big city assignment, get you away from the little Morristown rag you'd 
been working on for seven years.

Apparently, the one thing you DIDN'T find out in your research was that those 
public officials OWN the newspaper chain, and that they're even more ruthless 
and immoral than you'd thought. Now, after being dragged out of bed and dumped 
into the pit itself, it looks like that promotion is a long way off.

Press any key to continue > u

But what IS in this pit? You've read facts about it in geological surveys. 
You've heard all the local folklore about the mythical creatures lurking down 
there -- the Wumpus was probably the most colourful monster of the bunch -- and 
you know for a fact that the city's been dumping toxic waste into it for years. 
Leave it to a bunch of suburban fat-cats to arrange a billion-dollar 
waste-disposal contract, and then just hire some local thugs to dump the stuff 
into a hole under Morristown. Could that toxic junk be leaking into the city's 
water supply? Lots of people are speculating, but nobody has had the courage to 
actually go DOWN there to check it out.

Press any key to continue > i

Well, looks like you've been reluctantly nominated. If you survive the fall, 
you might get a chance to solve these mysteries...and maybe win a Pulitzer 
Prize to boot! You've been falling for a long time, and it's almost time to 
land...for better or for worse.

And hey, maybe that Wumpus thing is really friendly?

You are in room #20, a fair-sized dead-end with rough, orange, fungus-spotted 
walls. Some of the fungus has been scraped off the wall, but it is slowly 
growing back. Stalagmites rise out of the floor, reaching for the roof of the 
cave. A thick, wet fog fills the chamber and gives the surroundings a 
dream-like quality. 

Exit 1 weaves toward an unexplored room. 

A waterfall cascades from an underground source, through the room, and into 
exit 1.  It fills the entire room with water.

There is an empty canteen here.
High above your head is the shaft you fell out of.

It appears that this skeleton on the ground has broken your fall.

Before the front gate
Well, you can understand why Uncle Steve certainly doesn't get a lot of 
visitors.  The path here is little more than a dirt track, with weeds and 
overgrown bushes crowding it from both sides.  And the view is less than 
stellar, the museum looming over you keeps bringing to mind words like "gloom" 
and "doom" and other words ending in "oom".

An ominious looking black iron gate bars the way north.

You kept telling your English teacher you'd have his copy of Waiting for Godot 
back "tomorrow". He's getting sick of waiting; you'd better find it tonight. 
You have just completed a thorough search of the porch, finding nothing but a 
rotting fish.

Porch
This is your porch. Icky. Books, papers, filth, and stuff you don't seriously 
want to think about is all over the place. Your book isn't here, though... 
where the bleep is it?

The kitchen is to the west, the back door of your house is to the south.

A herring lies dead on the porch floor... you don't want to know.

You can also see a small brown box (which is closed) here.

Eric The Power-Mad Dungeon Master
by Mark Arenz

[9:38pm on a Saturday in 1981.  D&D night at Eric's]

Long ago ... in the time of Arbaldu, lord of the short forest- or something 
like that-
Josh: Can we just get on with this?
Everybody shut the hell up!  This is how things go every time I DM, and I'm 
sick of it.  You guys seem to think you can back-sass the Dungeon Master and 
get away with it.   Well, just remember that I have the power to smite you all 
at will.
Brad: You keep saying that, Eric, but I'm not convinced that you know what it means.

My finger is on the smiting button right now.  Don't test me.

Oh, a little bad news first.  Some Yoohoo may or may not have been spilled on 
the new map.
Josh: You've got to be kidding.
Mistakes were made, alright?  Get over it.  The good news is that I memorized 
the whole thing when we were making it last week, so everything will be fine 
like cherry wine.  Let's get started.

A Galactic servant, that's what you feel like at the moment.  You'd think that 
the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for 
discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were 
instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their 
gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on 
Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's 
gratitude for you.

However, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but 
to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for 
Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for 
Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much 
for Gallifreyan hospitality...

Your thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.  The TARDIS has 
landed on Karn.

Dead Reckoning
By Andrªs Viedma Pel©ez

From the Spanish "Olvido Mortal"
Translated by Nick Montfort, 2003
Release 1 / Serial number 030730 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Would you like to read the instructions? (You should read them once before you 
begin to learn about special commands.) quit
Please answer yes or no.> y

At the beginning of this adventure the protagonist is unable to remember anything and has to recover his memory. This situation calls for a few special commands, but not too many.

One verb has special importance in the game, and can be used in two ways:

1. REMEMBER
2. REMEMBER <topic>

REMEMBER alone causes the player character to make a special effort to remember things in general. Whether or not a thing can be remembered depends on context, and on whether something has previously occurred that can help you remember.

Using REMEMBER with a topic allows you to concentrate on a particular topic and try to recall something about it.

There are several methods of communicating with characters:

1. TALK TO <character>
2. SAY <your-statement> TO <character>
3. ASK <character> FOR <thing>

The first of these begins menu-based conversation, allowing you to speak with characters by selecting pre-established options. These include some of the things troubling the character at the moment, the normal questions people might have or those that bear on things that have happened. These options can appear at any moment depending upon the context and what has happened. In fact, a conversation itself can give rise to new options on the conversation menu.

The second and third options are different forms of the same command. They allow you to say something specific or ask about a particular topic. These would usually be used for more "advanced" conversation which isn't obvious, and which requires the player to discover the topic.

An important note: these two modes of conversing (menu-based conversation with TALK TO and direct discourse with SAY and ASK) are complementary. Certain answers can only be obtained using one method, certain other ones using the other method. You shouldn't always expect to be understood if you try to use SAY and ASK with topics that refer to things from the conversation menus.

Another command that can be useful is SUMMARY. In this adventure, there is some knowledge that the protagonist has recovered and some which is still "lost" (that is, it is not yet known with certainty). This command provides a summary of what the protagonist knows. This summary won't include everything the protagonist has done, not even all the important things. What it should include, at least, is the information needed to indicate what the protagonist has remembered so far.

Other useful commands -- which will be familiar to those who have previous experience with interactive fiction -- include L(OOK), (E)X(AMINE), I(NVENTORY), TAKE, DROP, SAVE, and RESTORE. This game should recognize other "logical" commands in natural language that might occur to the player. The vocabulary is certainly not limited to the commands listed here.

Office
You are in an office space.

You can find no sign explaining what exactly this place is. The line extends all through this enormous space, yet a wall keeps you from seeing where it finally ends. The row of people continues through an open door in the wall. In the other direction, you can't see over the heads of the people to where the front of the line is.

Here on the floor is the woman ahead of you in line.

You're in a circular room, with old, worn stones set into the wall.  Torches 
rest in brackets on the wall, lighting the area well enough for you to see.  A 
narrow corridor heads north, and that seems to be the only exit from here.

There's some sort of panel on the wall nearby.

 You live in a Home. Not your average, middle of the street home, but a home 
for the Confused. I.e. an asylum. 
 You were put there after being found guilty of instigating the great Gerbil 
Riot of 1967. A heinous crime. 

 You have a hobby - escaping. To date you have been unsuccessful but you decide 
to give it one last try.

'Treatment' Room
 The 'Treatment' room. All the inmates associate this place with pain and 
suffering. Threatening machinery glares at you from around the walls. 
 One cupboard in particular demands your attention and a body slumped on the 
floor brings back uneasy memories. 
 The open doorway is South.

I await your advice.

Mines

Copyright (c) 1979, 2005-2009 James L. Dean

Version 2010.10.29 released October 29, 2010

This z-machine program may be distributed or used without payment to its 
author. Derivative works must credit its author.

"Mines" lets you explore mines. The mine you explore is determined by a mine 
number specified at the beginning of a game.

The object of a game is to visit all of the rooms and return all of the 
treasures to the entrance without making too many moves.

In a mine, the passages are straight. So, for example, if you go North to leave 
a room, you can go South to reenter it. The rooms are not evenly spaced. 
However, the distance between adjacent rooms is always a multiple of the 
minimum distance between adjacent rooms.

Commands in the game are "N", "E", "S", "W", "U", and "D" to move North, East, 
South, West, Up, or Down, respectively. Other commands are "C" to carry things, 
"I" to inventory what you are carrying, "L" to leave treasures, "P" to get the 
points you've scored, "O" for help getting out of the mine, "H" for help, and 
"Q" to quit.

Mine Number? 

You're in the entrance to the mine.

The passage east is guarded by a gorgon.

"It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand 
Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We 
have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, 
never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is 
Matchlick the Mighty. So 'tis you. 

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. 

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun 
and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. 
Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, 
long-ago buried for countless ages." 

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. 

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, 
"take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things" a 
brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use 
whatsoever. 

"But what of Kolchack the --" 

Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses 
briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own 
question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" 

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out 
of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the 
newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a 
rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In 
the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic 
blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven 
glow.

nearby, bathing you in cosmic radiation.  It only made the twelth page of the 
paper, under Dear Abby.  Of course, if anyone could have foreseen the awful 
effects of that accident, it surely would have been a front page story.  But 
there was no way for you, or anyone else, to predict that the result of that

The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively 
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem 
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

 Dear Blogreaders, 
 yesterday was the strangest day of my life! The things I have seen - and done 
- it was so strange...so horrible. And yet, wonderful. You remember that guy 
from the Psychology course? Paul? We had a date the day before yesterday. Some 
people already emailed me with questions regarding how it went. But sorry, 
especially to you, Toby43, but I was to tired, and, honestly, toO drunk to go 
online that night. I'll skip that part, maybe I'll write about it later, 
because I have to tell you what went down this night. Paul was throwing this 
big New-Years-Eve  party and he invited me (of course, I may add with what 
little self-esteem I have), to help him organize - and stay overnight.
 That's how it all started. I arrived in the midst of the party, because I was 
visiting my family before that. So when I went in the door, Paul rushed at me. 
I couldn't have anticipated what happened next, that this would turn into...

The Day I shot Hitler
An interactive Party by Taleslinger
Release 2 / Serial number 081206 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Paul, his brown hair in a cute pony-tail, rushes at you, a huge bowl of eggnog 
in his hand. He told you yesterday that he prepared it carefully after some old 
family recipe. He looks at you in utter horror, squeaking: "Mice."
"Of me to drop by?"
"No, Mice. They were in the house yesterday, and now one is in my eggnog." His 
voice is but a whisper.
"Hm, throw it away?" you suggest carefully.
"No, Alex, everyone is waiting for it. Also, the noodles haven't arrived yet 
and the sandwiches are disappearing rapidly.So people need something to feed 
on." 
Right at that moment, the head of a small mouse pokes out of the liquid. The 
little bugger looks around, then begins to swim around quite happily.
"Get rid of these foul vermin! Save my eggnog."
You both look down on the swimming mouse. "And please don't hurt the poor 
little creature." With that, Paul disappears into the living room, leaving the 
bowl in your hands.

hallway
A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of neon lights. Dark wooden stairs lead 
upwards, and a doorframe opens west into the Living Room. A small door under 
the stairs lead into a storage closet. (Referred to by Paul only as "The Potter 
Room".)
Your steps don't make any sound on the the thick, red carpet.

You can see a chest of drawers (closed) here.

 Credits

Graham Nelson and Andrew Plotkin have made many contributions to our world. 
Without Inform and "Lists and Lists" this game would not be. 

Larry Kwong tested "Informatory" and suggested it be made into an honest 
tutorial. This is the result. 

Jennifer Vaughan, Neil Cerutti, and Barbara Wood tested the game. They earned 
their many thanks.

 Notes

This game may not work at all on some versions of the Z-Machine since it relies 
on some obscure features that may not have been implemented or may have been 
improved away. See the appendix on Z-Machines in the Book of Inf. It does work 
on WinFrotz. If you get a crash when attempting to create or modify objects, 
try the split command as discussed near the end of Section 104 of the Book of 
Inf.

  Than of a threadbare saint in wisdom's school.
   
                    - Thomas Dekker (1572-1632)]

You worked hard to get here. You studied late, saved the money from your part 
time jobs, and listened endlessly to your mother's hopes for you. She 
sacrificed to help you in your quest, and boy did she let you know it. Finally, 
the admission letter arrived. 

You have never really been away from home before, just trips to nearby towns 
for high school games. But now, two days of travel by coach train are over. The 
city is a new experience for you, strange and wonderful and busy. It is an old 
city, not large, and it wears its age with grace and pride. You make your way 
through the twisting streets, and at last you enter the campus. 

You won admission; you have the creased letter with you on this great day. This 
is your first day of school.

Leafy Quadrangle
This pleasant, grassy quadrangle is shaded by magnificent trees. Peaceful, 
almost cloistered, it eases your nervous excitement with a sense of serenity 
and high purpose. It is everything you had imagined the campus of a renowned 
institution of higher learning would be. 

The entrance to the distinguished, ivy covered, administration building lies 
directly east, and there is an inviting path winding around the building to the 
southeast. The impressive archway of the campus gate stands to the west. Beyond 
the gate is the muted bustle of the city and its myriad attractions.

The Dark Ages have arrived, and in King Demas's kingdom
the knights of the Chaise Longue have been sent forth from
Castle Moan to redeem the honour of the realm by a quest
for the Sangraal (or Holy Grail). Visions of this mystical
object have been vouchsafed to knights of great purity and
prowess, but, so far, nobody has managed to bring the thing
back for the royal trophy case. It is up to you...
You are standing by the drawbridge in Castle Moan. A
cheering crowd urges you to go out to certain death on
a quest for the Sangraal, as have many knights before you.
The road leads out northwards over the drawbridge.

Dozing lazily in the morning sun in your little hut, something suddenly makes 
your ears go stiff. You scan the air, trying to figure out what it was. You 
stretch your paws, reluctantly wag your tail, and get up.
Vigorously shaking the dust off of your fur, you have a sudden insight: the 
perfect shape of a bone forms in your mind. Yeah, that's it! Somewhere, 
somehow, there must still be a bone left from last fall. If only you could 
remember where it was...

It is the hottest summer of all time (or at least it feels that way now that 
your electricity has been cut off). Your lack of employment has finally caught 
up with you. Your funds have been depleted and your pockets are empty. Last 
month's essentials (cable television and Internet access) are now but sweet 
memories. The lack of air conditioning feels like the final straw. You were 
really hoping to starve to death at a comfortable 68 degrees.

Yesterday for lunch you boiled and ate two hot dog wieners. For dinner, you 
drank the water you boiled them in. (Mmm, "Hot Dog Soup".) So far your dignity 
has kept you from rummaging through trash cans for food, but it's starting to 
sound like a viable option. Just the thought of sinking your teeth into someone 
else's left over pizza crust makes your mouth water.

The current economy has made it hell for a spoiled, out-of-work computer 
programmer such as yourself to find work.  It wasn't too long ago that a 
five-figure salary seemed beneath you; today, given your current state of 
affairs, you would accept four. It's time to find a job and find some food, and 
find them today.

Living Room
While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back when you 
were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place up. Now that you 
have all the time in the world, you have no money. Even in hard times, you 
retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch sits along one wall, facing your 
cheap (and empty) entertainment center. The front door of your home is to the 
NORTH. Your dining room lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.

(First time playing Hangar 22? Type ABOUT. Need a list of common commands? Type 
COMMANDS.)

Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming in, and 
vice versa (it's called physics).

You can also see a couch, a fish bowl, an entertainment center and a coffee 
table (on which is a remote control) here.

Welcome to the world of St Borogrund's School - a world of intrigue, mystery, 
deceit, and excruciatingly bad dinners. Above a scattering of ugly grey 
outbuildings, Borogrund's four-storey tower block rises to assault the eye in a 
bitter and largely futile attempt to get a second glance. 

The end of term looms, and with it the prospect of your school report. Your 
parents have made it very clear that the report must praise you as a talented 
and conscientious individual. Being none of the above - but ever loyal to your 
parents - you make it your quest to seek out the offending report and... amend 
it. 

Borogrund's isn't just a strange name. It's a strange place. Expect the 
unexpected. Predict the unpredictable. And for pity's sake, don't go into the 
staff room unprepared...

Form room
Sunlight filters into your form room, where you are obliged to register each 
morning and afternoon, and falls across the tables as though reluctant to get 
itself dusty on the linoleum floor. The school's budgetary concerns are 
manifested in the hard wooden chairs and scratched, worn desks which surround 
you. A doorway leads east.

777-G 59/59. Your heroics in saving the galaxy from the evil alien pyramid 
resulted in a big promotion, but your life of dull paperwork has been replaced 
by a life of dull people work: escorting ambassadors, high-ranking officers of 
the Stellar Patrol, and government officials; and inspecting starships and 
space stations. Today you find yourself in a space scooter bound for a space 
station to perform a spot check, and also deliver some radioactive isotopes for 
their reactor, using the scooter instead of the teleport in order to surprise 
everyone. You've been a bit delayed due to a diplomatic crisis on Omicron III 
and your scooter isn't equipped with communication equipment, so you are 
arriving unannounced. Hey, rank does have its privileges, and it is meant to be 
a spot check...

A fan whirls slowly overhead - moving the stagnant air around.

dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh 
flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway 
to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears 
a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

Credits and Notes

Many thanks to Ola Sverre Bauge, Larry Kwong, and David Glasser for testing. 
Thanks also to Ben Hines, Mary Kuhner, and Marnie Parker for pointing out 
problems in the first release. 

With apologies and thanks to Graham Nelson the developer of Inform for his 
kind, if silent, permission to use bits of the Inform Manual. Also to Andrew 
Plotkin whose genie I have stolen and whose idea I have trivialized. And to all 
those others who have been researched. 

Special mention should be made of Douglas R. Hofstadter and his delightful book 
"Gdel, Escher, Bach" for many of the ideas that underlie this game.

Filthy, battered, itching fiercely from an unrecognized encounter with 
poisonous plants, and nearly exhausted, you have been slogging these bleak and 
forbidding lands for weeks. You drained your account at the Absconders and 
Defaulters National Bank to mount this expedition, and now the gin is running 
out. You don't even want to think about your liver. It may not be worthy of 
exhibit in the British Museum, but the pathology department at the Hot Cross 
Hospital will certainly be interested. 

You feel like weeping; you might as well have stayed by the slit in the stream 
bed and waited for plate tectonics to widen it. You are in front of that all 
too familiar white house again!

West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house.  The front door is not 
boarded up; there is no need. To the right of the door is a small window, 
apparently a recent remodel, which is slightly ajar. 

A rugged path to the west winds into the badlands.

The massive steel front door, which would do credit to a bank vault, is tightly 
closed.

There is a small mailbox here, of course.

You were celebrating the arrival of the not-quite-second-half of the 21st 
century with your buddies in your gaming basement when the bad news arrived: 
Crazy Uncle Scott had finally given up the good fight and passed off into 
gaming nirvana. He was an unusual man, with a firm belief that the world went 
to hell in a hand-basket with the arrival of text messages, always claiming 
that their phones were smarter than them! So he bought himself a huge mansion 
and spent his last days there pining for the glory days of yore, when websites 
were nothing more than acres of bright blue links thrown willy-nilly onto a 
computer screen.

Somehow, though, he took a shine to you, and you were smart enough to hide your 
smartphone whenever he came calling. Nevertheless, it was quite a surprise to 
learn that he left you exactly half his will. And even more of a surprise to 
discover that the lawyer's language was precise: not half his massive fortune 
in Geekgold, but literally half his will. Along with a short note explaining 
that to collect your full inheritance, you must retrieve the second half of 
Crazy Uncle Scott's will from his old estate, Alden Manor. The very name brings 
chills to your spine: that place is haunted!

But the true horror lay in the closing passage of the note:
Leave your Smartphone at home!

And so it stands before you, a house that could have been cozy, if not for the

Subject: War Warning

1. Approximately three (3) hours ago, warships of the Imperial Klingon Empire 
Navy crossed the border into Federation space. These vessels have destroyed all 
outposts and ships in their path and have not answered any hails.

2. Therefore, effective immediately, a state of war exists between the United 
Federation of Planets and the Imperial Klingon Empire.

3. As the Enterprise is the only vessel available in this portion of the 
galaxy, your orders are as follows:

4. Engage and destroy any and all Klingon vessels you encounter within your 
designated patrol zone. Long range sensor scans indicate a total of 14 Klingon 
battlecruisers in your area.

5. Starfleet Operations calculates that it will take approximately 28 days to 
mobilize our forces and begin sending reinforcements to the front. We need you 
to hold off the invading Klingon fleet until those reinforcements arrive.

6. Good luck and good hunting.

you is your brother's startled cry. You managed to swerve around the shadowy 
figure that appeared in the roadway, but lost control as the car jumped the 
shoulder and plunged headlong into this tree.

Monastery Chapel
You are standing in a monastery chapel. All around you, fellow Brothers of the 
Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into 
the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep 
concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
You are caught up in the collective chanting, and cannot break your 
concentration to do much of anything else.

Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.

"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. 
Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of 
Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in 
turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us."

You pull on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, collect your books and head out 
for class. Gregory Dumont, Ph.D. is giving one of his crash courses in physics 
and you swore this time you'd get the stuff down cold.

As you approach the classroom the smell of popcorn wafts through the door, and 
you find Dumont inside, showing a Marx Brothers movie to an empty room.

"Oh! So we have a class! Welcome!" Dumont says excitedly as he ushers you in. 
He looks at the film for a moment, chuckles, then switches it off. "Since it's 
just the two of us, and it's a nice day, why don't we walk over to the Research 
Zone? I'm working on an experiment there," Dumont says, scratching his wild 
frizzy hair then reaching for his coat. "We can consider it a lab class."

The Research Zone, shrouded in mystery since the last big experiment blew the 
roof off the billion-dollar facility, has been off limits to students. You are 
honored that Dr. Dumont is allowing you, a lowly physics student, access to a 
privileged area.

After walking for what feels like miles down the brightly lit twisty hallways 
of the Research Zone, Dumont stops abruptly and opens a door. Fumbling for a 
light switch inside, you hear him cursing under his breath, "Ah, here it is!" 
and the room is washed in light.

Inside there are mounds of books, magazines, popcorn, clustered around a 
massive wooden desk while across the room is a curtained area. Dumont sees you 
eyeing the curtain. "Shall we see what's behind curtain number three?" he asks 
you with a sly smile.

He pulls the curtain back briskly and a chill runs up your spine. There, amidst 
a tangle of wires, computers and a huge wall poster of the university's 
underground particle smashing cyclotron, sits a gleaming, black, human-shaped 
shell the size of a sports car. The lid is open.

"You see, it's quite simple. Particle physics isn't particle physics without 
human observation--it's just particles. So, when we insert one human, voila! 
Particle physics!" Dumont looks at you with a gleam in his dark blue eyes. 
"You're not taking notes?" he asks as he walks to a computer console.

Slowly, he fingers a few buttons while lost in some unfathomable thought 
processes, his gaze intent on the black shell. Luckily, he seems to be busy 
with things other than you.

Just as you start to think it might be prudent to find your way out through the 
labyrinthine hallways, he pulls up a lab stool for you to sit on. There is an 
intensity about him that rivets your attention. You can feel his excitement as 
he looks inside the black shell, checking wires that run along the inside.

"The shell is linked to the A.I. computer, which is linked to the cyclotron. 
The computer will learn from interacting with the human mind how to view the 
elusive particle which has escaped our detection so far--Particle X. Sort of a 
creative jump start, if you will," he says. "The computer just doesn't have the 
intelligence needed by itself."

Dumont sheds his coat and reaches for a white lab coat draped over a chair. 
"Now, the A.I. machine loads metaphors into the human brain for what is going 
on inside the cyclotron. And the human brain, being creative, tries to find 
meaning within the metaphors and, ultimately, views Particle X. Once that 
happens, the A.I. computer adjusts, learns, and becomes a particle viewing 
machine. And then, voila! The human can go home and get some sleep!"

He pulls the lab coat on and excitedly jabs a few buttons on the computer. 
"Then, you ask, what must it be like inside the shell, linked to a metaphor of 
the sub-atomic world?" You weren't even thinking of asking that. You were 
thinking of asking if you could transfer into another physics class. Any other 
physics class. "Now that's the interesting part," he continues. "I did most of 
the programming for P.A.R.T.I. myself--Particle Accelerator and Reality 
Translation Integrator.'

Dr. Dumont begins to pick up speed as he talks, whisking you and your 
imagination along with him. He grabs the lapels of his own lab coat as if to 
shake himself. "There's a shortcut to genius inside of P.A.R.T.I. somewhere, 
but you know I'm afraid the metaphors will be too personal for just anybody to 
make sense of them, too much of my own personality, my likes and dislikes."

He shakes his head, "But who knows?!! They won't let me try it out! I could be 
the first human to experience sub-atomic life, but do they give me that honor? 
Nooooo!" Dumont gestures wildly as he talks. "They've decided to train a 
subonaut, someone who will be groomed for the mission."

He throws back his mane of wild hair and laughs. "Subonaut! Sheesh!" He paces 
across the room then turns to you. "The experience will take only a few 
moments, but it won't feel that way to the person inside the shell. Time will 
be suspended and drawn out, rather dramatically I suspect."

Dr. Dumont leans forward, peers at you as if to see whether you've taken it all 
in, then steps over to the shell. He adjusts a wire inside the shell.

"If I could just make a few adjustments, but the darn subonaut hasn't been 
selected yet..."

He turns his piercing blue gaze on you, "Would you mind? Getting in the shell I 
mean? Just for a moment? I only need the physical dimensions of a body, yours 
will do fine," he says happily, gesturing to the awaiting interior.

You look at the black acrylic shell, not so chilling as when you first laid 
eyes on it. Dumont seems so intent on adjusting those wires in the shell, you 
feel compelled to help him out. Maybe this will even boost your grade, you 
speculate, as you slide into the contours of its inner dimensions. Dumont 
reaches over you to bring down the biolink electrodes, attaching the small 
wired disks to your temples, your arms, torso, and legs.

"Now, where did I put that screwdriver?" Dumont ruminates, as he disappears out 
of sight for a second.

The second draws out. You get fidgety. You hear the deep thrumming of the 
particle accelerator, feel its vibrations through the shell. Dumont doesn't 
seem to be returning. As you pull yourself up for a peek, your hand hits 
something along the outer edge of the shell and you hear an ominous click. The 
black shell quickly begins to close as you get a glimpse of Dumont running 
across the room shouting, "Oh my Gosh! Stop! Wait!" and then the shell lid 
clicks securely shut.

The last thing you hear is Dumont shouting, "This isn't going to get you an A, 
you know!" before you black out.

Bedroom
You're in a bedroom. Everything about this room seems normal on one level and 
yet oddly different on another. A quick scan around the room makes you 
ill-at-ease, as if you don't belong here. Or perhaps the room itself doesn't 
belong anywhere. A dresser complete with a mirror lies off to one side, against 
a white, featureless wall. A door is off to the west while to the south, 
through a doorway, you can see what must be a small bathroom.

you? There's no way you'll turn to stealing car radios and the like, that's for

missing. He's probably gone, too. You think that his name was Simon.

You're probably gone too, because every time you start talking, your words keep

McDonald's Hamburger Restaurant, Miami Beach, Florida (on your seat)
Not exactly the holiday of a lifetime. You've come here to investigate the 
mysterious disappearance of several UFOs in the Bermuda Triangle (which, as 
you've discovered, is not a triangle but a trapezium, stretching as far back as 
New Mexico), but the authorities have been doing everything they can to block 
you. The girl in the City Hall even pretended not to know what you were talking 
about! If you were the paranoid type, you'd suspect the aliens themselves were 
in on the conspiracy, but no, it's probably just the usual government cover-up.

All the same, it's best to lie low for a while. To avoid suspicion (not to 
mention the mosquitoes) you've camped down for the afternoon in this innocuous 
family restaurant, drinking coffee. And what better way to pass the time than 
play an Infocom game on your PalmPilot? You can't beat the old-school games, 
and in Infidel's case, you literally can't beat it. In fact, you've been stuck 
in the slab room for sixteen years. Sixteen years -- now that's entertainment.

Truth be told, though, that puzzle is starting to irritate you now. As is the 
foul-smelling vagrant who has seated himself at the table opposite you. To see 
such people in McDonald's of all restaurants! Standards really have fallen, and 
not just in the IF community.

As we sew the tapestry of our lives, we work with only one thread at a time.  
Some are bright, some dark, some with colors we can't quite describe.

At the moment, you are working with one particularly dull, frayed thread, and 
one sorry excuse for a needle.  The events of the past year are immaterial 
right now.  All you know is that "home" is not what it used to mean, and this 
is not where you want to be.

If you could just get away... even for an hour or two.

Living Room
This is the cultural center of apartment F209.  Its true symbolic magnificence 
is once again belied by its current squalid nature.  You wonder for a while how 
anyone could actually live in a place like this, until you remember that you 
pay the rent here.  The endless white of the undecorated walls is interrupted 
only by a hallway to the south, the kitchen to the east, and the front door to 
the north.

The front door is closed, displaying its chipped, off-white countenance with 
pride.

A large, selfish cat stares at you impatiently.

Darkness; below, percussion throbs softly. You shift from foot to foot, 
conscious of too much open space around you.

Ahead and on either side, the voice of the chorus rises; as they speak, the 
lights slowly go up.

CHORUS:
Now does the hour grow close; where feet lack time,
And Spaniards rage before the Cockrel's gate,
The condemned sinner, soul turned sick of vice,
Shall craft before your eyes most unclean magics,
Open him a gate to Hell's black womb,
Release demons, and bid them convey
Our heroes to fair France; there to signal
Embattl'd men to a final desperate measure.
The final act is begun; the play is in your hands.

Stage (A German Forest)
You are onstage, a wide expanse of blank floor facing onto darkness. Nestled 
behind a curtain's edge is the exit leading offstage.

The backdrop features an unconvincing painting of pine-covered mountains and a 
dark, ominous sky in which a double-headed eagle is carrying off a schnitzel.

It was only seconds ago that the sound of a gunshot caught you off guard.  Now, 
here you are, cradling your sidekick and friend, Snam, close to the ground.  
"Not Snam!!" you think to yourself, "After all he's done for me..."  It was he 
who took care of your niece when your sister asked you to babysit.  It was he 
that always let you win in Stratego. Now, in this final act of selflessness, he 
lies dying from a shot from Doctor Nova's gun, leaking life from the very 
bullet that was meant for you.  Tears well up in your eyes when you think how 
Snam will never get that plant you got him for his birthday.  You spent so much 
time picking it out and everything...

Your attention is diverted by an evil chortle, and your gaze barely catches the 
blur of white as Doctor Nova runs out the door to the north.  You'll pursue him 
soon enough, but for now, your attention returns to your fallen comrade.

"Listen," Snam chokes out. "You gotta get that bastard." After these final 
words, his body promptly goes limp in your hands.  You carefully lower him to 
the floor.

"Oh, I'll get him alright," you growl to yourself as you turn towards the door. 
 "I'll get him good."

The Beginning of the End
You and Snam came a long way to get this far.  First, you had the trouble of 
tracking down clues and following the trail of innocent victims that led you 
here.  Then, there was the battle of epic proportions with Nova's countless 
minions.  To top it off, you had to deal with that dastardly crocodile pit (and 
you would've helped Snam wrestle them, too, if only reptile skin didn't make 
you feel so icky).

But now, Snam's dead and you've got to make things right.

You have an ominous, uneasy feeling, walking about this room. You're not sure 
whether to attribute this to the eerie, curious shadows that dart about the 
floor and walls or to the fact that you made the unwise decision to fight evil 
with a stomach full of chili. The doorway to the north seems to be your only 
exit.

Your friend, Snam, lies dead on the floor, face up.

The last thing that you remember is standing before the wizard Lakmir as he 
waved his hands. Now you find yourself staring at an entryway which lies at the 
edge of a forest. The druid's words ring in your ears:

"Within the castle Shadowgate lies your quest. The dreaded Warlock Lord will 
use his black magic to raise the Behemoth from the dark depths. The combination 
of his evil arts and the great titan's power will surely destroy us all! You 
are the last of the line of kings, the seed of prophecy that was foretold eons 
ago. Only you can stop the evil one from darkening our world forever! Fare thee 
well."

Gritting your teeth, you swear by your god's name that you will destroy the 
Warlock Lord!

You are in a prison that has 32767 cells. The Guv' has said that a new policy 
has been brought in by the Gov'. Due to prison crowding they're offering every 
prisoner the chance to be freed.

In order to decide who gets set free, The Guv' will ask each prisoner which 
cell they choose. The prisoner will then be escorted to that cell where they 
will spend the night.

During the night, a piece of card will be attached to each cell door on which 
will be written the word "keep" on one side and the word "release" on the 
other. The piece of card will start off with the word "keep" visible.

The Guv' will turn around every piece of card so that the word "release" is now 
visible. Afterwards every second piece of card will be turned then every third 
and so on until the last card has been turned.

"I don't make the rules," he says, "I only go to ridiculous lengths to enforce 
them."

If at dawn when all the cards have been turned, the word "keep" is visible on a 
cell door, its prisoner will be forced to live out the rest of their sentence, 
but if the word "release" is visible on a cell door, its prisoner will be 
released.

"Alright, you little oik," says The Guv',"which cell is it going to be?"

>
Picking a number at random, you tell The Guv' that you choose cell number 
"twenty-three thousand, nine hundred and nineteen" to spend the night in.

You are then escorted to that cell where spend a restless night, worrying over 
whether your maths was right. Early next morning, The Guv' comes in and takes 
ahold of your hand. You get an eerie sensation that all your troubles are just 
beginning. You are then blindfolded and led away from the cell.

For saying the first thing that came to mind, you are brought out into the yard 
just in time to see dozens of your fellow inmates freed. They've even given 
some of them instruments!

Your mind dissolves as it touches the pillow. Today has been a busy day, and 
tomorrow will probably be no differant. But your not thinking about that, 
because your mind has already dissolved.

Like liquid, your thoughts drip together, falling from mist and mildew. Soon a 
dream forms. A small lizard is dancing to bad jazz. He's on his hind legs, 
kicking like Russians must have kicked during the Cold War. After what seems 
like minutes, he turns to you. His tounge flickers like a dying candle. There 
are no sounds, yet his tounge's writhing and curls seem to talk. "I am the Toe. 
Tips nil like math ah tame kill in spit."  Then the tounge stretches over to 
your face and pokes your eyes. Blinded, your nostrils suddenly become 
extrasensory as the scent of burn engine oil streams in. Then your ears go into 
overdrive as a manic laughter surrounds your being. The scariest part, is your 
not so sure that it's not you laughing. You start running. Blindly.

Movement across the Disc is perhaps noteworthy at this point. 

Unlike the usual fantasy environment, The Discworld does not have a north, 
south, east or west. Instead, and more suitably, there are two main directions: 
Hubward & Rimward. However, as the Disc itself revolves at the rate of once 
every 800 days, there are two lesser directions: Widdershins & Turnwise.n

maintenance!
Well, machines that can talk fluently and even understand what you say are

Anyway, this afternoon your curiosity is going to be satisfied...

ZEN SPEAKS! (or 1999: A Quite Brief Space Odyssey)

- annoying background "music" using standard sound effects
- rudimentary text-to-speech (producing a horrible robot-like voice)
- a very primitive Eliza-style response system

Grammar Room 16
The main exhibit on the second floor: Room 16, south of the mezzanine. A 
Jeffreys Tube runs east into a Star Trek: The Next Generation room, while a 
hexagonal sliding door to the south blocks the entrance to the bridge of the 
spaceship "Liberator".

The room looks strangely unadorned, however. There were many exhibits on your 
previous visit. Oh, and there was also that spiteful little girl (what was her 
name? Cecilia? Carmen?), and that curious guy who misunderstood commands... 
both museum employees, not visitors. Maybe they're on vacation?

An exhibition leaflet has fallen to the floor.

What looks like a phone booth pedestal stands in a corner, under a poster 
attached to the wall.

exits. The room is lit by a large window that is next to a closed door.

...The day after, the local paper remains untouched on his doorstep. A week 
later friends, then neighbours, and then the police search for him in vain. 
After a fortnight, his wife comes to you, begging for help.

Apparently he told some cock-and-bull story about his Grandfather's will and 
set off, determined to hunt around a museum in the middle of the night, with 
only a broken old flashlight he'd found in the attic. Of course, you know that 
makes no sense. Old Edgar Mulldoon isn't dead; you met him last Wednesday.

Which all leaves you, with a dodgy torch of your own, set to find the idiot. 
It's no fun being a gumshoe.

The memo was something of a surprise. You'd featured rather heavily in the 
issue before, and had reasonably suspected that the editor wouldn't want to see 
hide nor hair of you for a while. However, summoned you have been.

The trouble with these meetings is, you'll never know where it'll lead; whether 
he'll ask you to write a few hundred words for a box-out, or to spend a day 
tramping round the London suburbs in search of the homes of C-list celebrities. 
Maybe it'll just be a straight commission. And if you're really blessed, he'll 
fall into the usual trap of rattling off so much information in the meeting 
that you'll only need to transcribe what you can remember. Such are the 
misdemeanours available to you when your boss is disturbingly well-informed and 
in love with the sound of his own voice.

Still, you've not much time. Best get your skates on, especially if the

You are standing at the edge of a deep uncrossable chasm with no memory 
whatsoever of how you got here, although the number 68 springs to mind for some 
reason.  A not-especially-dark passage leads southwest and a grisly hole in the

You there, you look depressed. How about I try to cheer you up, eh? Would you 
like to hear a story?

Well, I admit it isn't the cheeriest story, but it's an interesting one. As far 
as I can tell, it first appeared on an Internet imageboard years ago, but I 
guarantee you it's a true story. Some of the details are a bit sketchy, though, 
seeing as how it's been around for so long.

You'd like to hear it? Alright then. Here goes.

If you go into this one tiny, dingy one-story bar in Paris, and the right 
bartender is behind the counter that night, you might be able to see a very 
exclusive gallery show of the lost works of one Henri Beauchamp. But, to get 
in, you have to prove you're a devotee of the artist.

You sit down directly in front of the bartender. He asks you, in clear and 
perfect English, "What would you like to partake of this glorious night?"

The sniveling, weak and simple-minded crypt things that make up the board of

aged -- and afraid! -- old men couldn't bear, for a moment, to think outside 
the box and consider your request to study Unnatural Mystic Phenomenon as 
completely valid. 

It took almost a month of cajoling, phoning and begging, but you finally got 
the lot of them together in one room so that you could plead your case in 
person. You recall how difficult it was, years ago, to get together the 
required cast for your PhD review at Syracuse, and it only increases the fury 
and contempt you have for the liverspotted trots before you today.

You will get your approval. You will complete your studies here in the desert, 
flanked by continually imported human decadence, the comforting warmth of the 
sun and, of course, easy showgirls. Or else you will be the end of these 
miserable, cowardly, academic dinosaurs!

It took you a little time to get your vampire costume together, so you've been 
running late for Gary's costume party.  You've arrived now on the ground floor 
of his high-rise apartment building.  Better late than never as they say.  

The elevator makes a soft jingle as it opens and you step into the mirrored 
interior.  For a moment you think, struggling to remember Gary's floor 
number...  Oh yes, you remember now, 15.  You reach out and push the 
appropriate button.  The doors begin to close but stop suddenly as a slender 
hand appears.  There's another jingle and the doors open again revealing a 
beautiful, red-headed girl dressed in a toga.  

You recognize her from campus although you do not actually know her.  For a 
moment you almost do not see the red rubber snakes entwined with her long red 
curls.  She steps into the elevator and reaches for a button, but stops, 
apparently seeing that it is already lit.  

It seems, you think as the doors close and the elevator begins to move, that 
this "Medusa" is going to same costume party that you are.

An elevator; pretty much like any other elevator you've ever been in. Your 
increased weight conveys the sensation of movement and the floor indicator 
above the closed doors changes as the elevator passes floors. Next to the 
elevator doors, several dozen buttons are arranged in two rows.

All the walls in this elevator are mirrored and exhibit a matrix of identical 
vampires and gorgons stretching to infinity in all directions.

A slender, red headed girl dressed as Medusa stands beside you.  Her 
reflections surround you in all directions.

>

The girl smiles at you. "I've always been fascinated with Greek mythology." She 
glances at her reflection in the mirror. "My room mate helped me make this.  
She's a theatrical major and gets a lot of experience working with costumes.  I 
understand her professor is a little on the cheap side so they often just have 
to make do."

That rings true to your ears, having taken some creative arts classes before.

>uit
That's not a verb I recognize.

>tell girl about theater
"I took theater for a couple of semesters and also remember Dr. Davidson being 
particularly budget conscious."

"So you came out of acting class with some experience making theater costumes," 
she says.  You watch her eyes look over your costume as though assessing your 
skills.

>tell girl about Dracula costume
"Dracula was always my favorite monster," you say, glancing at one of your many 
reflections.

"I used to stay up late at night and watch vampire shows with my father when I 
was a little girl.  At least I did when he wasn't working."

You grimace. "Not exactly Sesame Street."

She shrugs.  "It's true.  I was too young to be watching those kinds of shows.  
Vampires scare me even today."

You are standing in the extremely well-equipped control room of your spaceship, 
which reflects the increase in your wealth following your last adventure. The 
only exit is north to the cargo hold.
Your robot dog is sitting here.
Petrov, your navigator, is standing alertly here.
Dimi, your engineer, is here.
Kara, your second-in-command, is with you.

     The e-mail has a surprising tone for a declaration of doom.

--------------------
From: Your Boss!
To: You
CC: Everyone

     Congratualtions!  Due to attrition among the ranks of middle managers, you 
have been promoted to management as of right now.  Have someone move your 
telephone and computer to your new office in the management section, and call 
me before the end of the day.

--------------------

     There is no reason to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for you.  
First, that message went to everyone, announcing that you have been promoted.  
As soon as your back is turned it will be so full of daggers you could open a 
cutlery shop.  On top of that, your phone has been broken for months.

     You tried begging, bribery, even threats.  You just can not get a new 
phone.  Now, you have to move to the new office, with a new phone, before the 
end of the day.  If you don't, you won't lose the promotion, you will lose your 
job.  Most new managers become sacrificial scapegoats for the board of 
directors on their first day.

     You will just have to be smarter than those other fledgling managers.  If 
you have problems, you can always resort to "Big D's Guide to Corporate 
Survival" (ie. the walkthrough).  You keep it in your desk drawer.

    Well, there is work to be done.  Get that phone and get your equipment to 
the new office.

Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you 
feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly 
nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your 
struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she 
pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the 
backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake 
up.

You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and 
distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason 
and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy 
objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. 
"Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice 
you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage 
the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of 
dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just 
arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, 
that's all." 
Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the 
Wise. 
"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. 
Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. 
Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. 
Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front 
of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of 
Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted 
weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly 
place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting 
a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. 
Might get in a lucky hit or something." 
Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to 
be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old 
tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." 
"Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other 
adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just 
happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with 
dangerous dragons or anything else. 
As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all 
quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. 
"Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul 
willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." 
Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey 
and cart and deposited beside a track. 
"Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries 
away. 

Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the

It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels 
and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the 
south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by 
the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far 
away to the west.

You are wearing a leaden overcoat stumbling down a hallway filled with strobe 
lights. Anxiety runs like an electric wire through your frame as you can feel 
the eyes upon you; eyes, forever-staring; eyes boring holes through your back; 
eyes peering out from translucent drawer-like plates in the hall. You hold your 
breath hoping somehow to black out, but the floor melts and the scene shifts. 

You are running down an endless plain on a moonless night, where the stars sit 
in judgement like needles waiting to fall upon you. It rains clocks and they 
pelt you as you run, dodging shattered stopwatches and blaring alarm clocks. 
The scene shifts again. 

Every action seems in slow-motion as though you were moving through time. You 
raise your head to look in the mirror and see yourself growing older, a year 
for every moment. You turn away and look back to see a skeleton staring back at 
you, its jaws gibbering madly. 

Then you are sleeping. A gentle touch upon your shoulder and you awake, 
blinking into focus a strange and yet uncannily familiar world. The abandoned 
parking lot and the broken streets keen with secrets just out of reach. Before 
you is the building. It lurks like a coiled dragon, a summation of fear and 
deadly challenge, of past and of present. You hear a final distant voice that 
seems a greeting as well as benediction, "This is the dark night of the soul."

Building
The building lurking before you, an endless night.

Before the Building
The building rises before you, a hulking shadow, blocking out the stars above 
and disfiguring the moon. Windows upon windows pit its smooth obsidian surface, 
glinting like tiny gasoline-colored eyes. A garrulous display of floodlights 
spray up from the ground floor like failed fireworks, casting writhing shadows 
from the dense bushes that ring the building except where the sidewalk splits 
them asunder. The slate sidewalk continues from the building, between the 
hedges to end at your feet, eroded smooth.

"You are cordially invited to the wedding of Deborah and Malcolm at St Jude's 
Church, Westlowe at 2.30pm." And, scrawled in the corner in what looks like 
your ex-flatmate Malcolm's handwriting: "Don't forget the paracetamol!"

So far so bad. You're no lover of weddings with egotistical aunts and uncles 
and squealing, hyperactive kids, but you were prepared to put up with it to see 
your old college chum get hitched. Now, though, things have taken a turn for 
the worse with a phone call from a posh sounding woman. "I understand you're a 
friend of Malcolm's" stated the voice on the phone. "You must come over here at 
once, and try to sort out this mess...". So that's why you find yourself 
tearing down the motorway towards Westlowe and the mysterious D'Arcy manor...

Outside the front entrance
You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like it's 
straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern touches help 
tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar alarm next to the 
elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man above the main entrance. 
Immediately in front of the house is a gravel drive which acts as a car park, 
and a small road leads off to the south towards the main road. A slabbed path 
runs around both sides (east and west) of the house.

You can see a security guard here.

Welcome to a day in the life of Betty Byline! Two months out of journalism 
school you enter the workplace with big time dreams of network television news. 
Fame, fortune and glory, all writ large under the unrelenting gaze of the klieg 
lights. There are eight million stories in the Naked City, and it's your job to 
tell them, tell them best, and tell them first.

Unfortunately this isn't the Naked City. This is Pleasantville, USA, population 
50,000. And you're not exactly working for the network news. You're working for 
local television station KTKO, the Knockout News Team -- a one camera, one 
reporter operation with a fat, balding old news director who smokes cheap 
cigars. Forget fortune and glory, for now your big career objective is not to 
have to give too many on-air endorsements of "Kletus's Used Car and Farm 
Implement Emporium." OK, so maybe you're not Dan Rather yet. Everybody has to 
start somewhere, and at least this is a start in front of a camera.

Your day begins in the KTKO newsroom, sitting at your desk. It may be yours, 
but right now your boss is treating it as his. His chair, specifically. Harry 
Jenkins is the news director at KTKO, and at the moment he has his chubby 
cheeks perched on the edge of your workspace. "Betty," he says, "I've got one 
whale of a first assignment for you. Word on the street is that the mayor and 
his latest intern have been stuffing the ballot box, so to speak. It's time for 
that adversarial relationship with the government they taught you about in J 
School. Get out there and get me the scoop!

"I know this is a lot to drop on you for your first day at work," he says. "But 
this station can only afford one reporter, so if I had someone more experienced 
to cover it, you wouldn't even have a job. I'll do my best to help you. 
Anything you turn up, anything anyone tells you, feel free to come ask me about 
it. And if you turn up any evidence we can use, tell me about it, and I'll help 
you figure out what to do with it."

As he hoists his heinie off your desk, Harry turns to look back one last time. 
"And don't think you're getting an exclusive! I'm hearing that Walker from the 
Daily Post is working the same story. This is big news, Betty! Get it for me 
before the Post, or get a new job!"

Jack Walker! You heard his name as soon as you came to town. He's the ace 
reporter for the local newspaper, KTKO's only competition. Well, if you want to 
make a splash, scooping the town's best reporter would be a good beginning. 
Start pounding the pavement, Betty. Your deadline is five PM.

It's all too quiet. No clatter of teletypes and keyboards, no colleagues 
shouting into the phone. There's just a radio playing "adult contemporary" 
music, and a window looking out on the sprawling streets full of ranch-style 
houses that make up Pleasantville. The only exit is to the north.

The curtain lifts to a torrent of applause, as the city's gents and ladies lose 
their decorum for a just few moments in anticipation of something magical. The 
spotlights drown the glitter of sequins and pearls, the metal cane-tops and the 
shining buttons on the waistcoats. From where you are, centre of the boards, 
behind nothing but a baize table with nothing but the clothes you stand in, you 
are quite alone in the blinding white light.

  The voice still echoes in your head. "Remember--if the bunny is not dead by 
midnight, the countryside will be ruled by evil." 

  You shiver as you think of the people dead in the street with bite marks on 
their neck. The cattle dead by the hundreds. The stories of a rampaging vampire 
bunny. A chill runs up your spine. 

  And lastly, you remember the strangeness of the graveyard the last time you 
saw it. The misty fog surrounding it. And now you're in the graveyard, alone, 
armed only with your apple and your trusty quill pen.

 (type "memo" for author's comments)

  Heads fly and body parts soar through the air as you swing your mighty sword 
at the horde of evil barbarians. One by one, the minions of the evil overlord 
Kroz persishes from the wrath of your unforgiving blade. As the last of them 
collapse in a bloody heap at your feat. You raise your arms and shout out in 
victory. Princess Zomar rushes up to your side and caresses your bulging 
pectorals.
  "Thank you, mighty one, for rescuing me from a fate worse than death," she 
says in a breathy voice.
  "Say no more," you respond. "It was not just my duty. It was my privilege."
  "You are wounded," she gasps as she sees the cuts along your rippling biceps. 
"I must annoint them with various balms and ointments. I need to gather the 
magic healing lotion and rub it ever so thoroughly all over your body. But 
first, I must dress the wounds. Please forgive me, for I have nothing to dress 
them with apart from my sheer silk nightgown."
  With that, she starts ripping off large shreds of her gown and gingerly wraps 
them around the wounds, taking time to slide her hands over your body. She 
leans towards you ear, brushing her large billowy breasts against your 
shoulder, and whispers, "BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP"

Your Bedroom (on the bed)
You blink your eyes as the blaring alarm jars you into waking reality. You come 
to the sad realization that it was all a dream. The well-endowed Priness Zomar 
ceases to be and your bulging pecs have been replaced by the reality that is 
your huge beer gut.

Your bedroom is a nicely orchestrated mess. Clothes and furniture are strewn 
about in an almost artistic fashion. Salividor Dali would proud, if you had any 
idea who he was. Right next to the unmade bed is a tiny, wooden dresser. The 
only exit is to the south.

On the tiny wooden dresser is a alarm clock.

Is it an innocent affection? An irrational obsession? An outright fetish? Or 
just a handy reference point for the term "disposable income"? You're certainly 
not generally given to nostalgia. Whatever the reason, you still enjoy playing 
old video games. Real ones, from back when games were games and movies were 
movies, and they never seemed to get themselves confused.

It's not as if you need a reason. Taking genuine pleasure in something 
automatically justifies it (and, you're convinced, also justifies having caught 
a train to this weird city). You don't have to think twice about the reason for 
which you attend these conventions. There are, put simply, a lot of games 
inside.

So what if all your spending money went to the train ticket? Salivating never 
hurt anyone.

Baer Boulevard
People walk up and down this ribbon of old brick buildings, alternately holding 
hands and giving each other the finger. Since you're on vacation, you try to 
remain patient long enough to take in the sights; but since these are mostly 
made up of the immense hotel to the south, inside which is the convention, you 
find this difficult. Alleys open to the southeast and southwest, and a nearby 
manhole gapes from within caution signs. Amazingly, given their various 
apparent conditions, the passersby seem to be heeding this advice (enough to 
avoid actually falling in, anyway).

The warm summer rain paints a pattern on the vespertine pavements of Rome. I'm 
in my shower while large drops of rain aggressively knock against the window, 
just to join with their siblings to form a rill.

I think of them. Each of them was so special. The delicate fingers pressing 
against the indestructible window pane which was supposed to keep evil out. The 
superior attitude suddenly giving way to despair. The widening eyes in the 
moment of cognition. I step out of the shower and let go of the memory. My 
mouth line is twisted into a bitter smile. My skin is dry.

"That'll be twenty five cents, Miss," says the driver as he helps you down from 
the carriage. You hand him a quarter and two nickels.

"Mighty lonely out here this time of year," he continues, slipping the coins 
into his coat pocket. "Are you sure you won't be wanting me to stick around? 
I'd hate to see such a fine young lady get herself stranded, especially with 
that storm blowin' in."

"Thank you, but I'll be fine," you assure him. "My fiance...," you start, then 
look away, unable to finish the lie.

"Ah, I see," he chuckles. "Well, then I wish you a pleasant afternoon. Just 
keep your eye on those clouds, ya hear?" Grinning broadly, he jumps up into the

          The Resident

  'You just visit the WEB, I live here.'

  Copyright 1995 by Mike DeSanto

  You are awake.  The clock says it is 2: 30 AM, so thee must be a reason you 
are awake.  Trusting your instincts, you get the Beretta handlaser from the end 
table.

  You move silently toward the bedroom door.  There are people who hate you, 
but most of them don't know who you are, and you just moved in here.  A change 
of residence and name come with every completed job.  There have been no 
hitches or displeased customers lately.

  Just as you reach for the door these thoughts are shattered.  The door 
disappears in a blinding, searing light.  Through the agony you feel the 
dresser opposite the door hit you in the small of the back, a trivial pain to 
the fire in the front of your body.

  Then something else starts.  A pushing feeling starting at your right hip.  
It continues diagonally to your left shoulder, leaving sharp points of 
suffering, like ten thousand bee stings across your body.  You feel yourself 
falling, but never feel the floor.

  With a start, you are awake.  Looking around, you see the red traceries and 
yellow disks of the WEB stretching out all around you.  you must have fallen 
asleep on line again.

  Your left arm itches, you must be laying on it.  You reach for the LOGOUT 
button, and find nothing.  The logout is gone.  Looking around a little more, 
everything is gone!  Your programs, even your Icon!  You spent hours on that 
icon.  Getting just the right amount of five o'clock shadow, just the right 
tackiness to the slippers.  It was a masterpiece!

  Just as you are starting to get nervous, a message appears on your deck.  
Strange dreams just before strange messages make you unhappy.  At least you 
have your backups at Bob's.

    You are standing in a standard Public node.  The 'ground' is a neon yellow 
disk, large enough for everyone present to fit, no matter how many people are 
here.

    In the center of the disk is a red pole with arrow shaped signs.  This is 
the transfer point to all connected nodes.

    Next to the Transfer Point is a large sign which reads "INFORMATION" in 
tall block capitals.  You can not read the rest without looking more closely.

    As usual, there are hundreds of people moving through this node.  Since 
this is where everyone starts when they log in, it tends to be a busy place.

This year too you decided to go for a walk to the book fair that takes place in 
the old town centre. After visiting the stand of the "Ludo Ergo Sum" club run 
by your friends Mario e Luigi, on the right side of the main street, you headed 
to Miky Bar to drink a beer to their health.

You're still having your drink when Mario bursts into the bar and says that the 
Cheshire Cat is missing! It is an unruly feline that meows all the time and 
pees and poos everywhere. But it is also the mascot of the club: without it 
your friends can't organize any other event, so it's a matter of life and death 
to find it as soon as possible.

Before letting you to your mission, Mario reminds you the rules to play a text 
adventure:

  - Every command has to be inserted with the syntax verb + noun: >get beer, 
>open door, >examine jacket, >wear hat, >ask girl about cat, >hit vandal...

  - To move from one place to another within the game world, you have to use 
the directions >north (or just n), >south (s), >east (e), >west (w), >up (u), 
>down (d).

  - The command >inventory (i) prints the list of the objects you have, while 
>look (l) shows the description of the place where you currently are.

  - The verbs you can use in this game are: get, examine, show and give 
[something to someone], ask and tell [someone about something], answer 
[something to someone], wait, sing, sleep, jump, listen, wear, remove, open, 
close, unlock, lock, hit, empty [something on something else], eat, drink, 
play, burn.

  - Examining the furnitures and the details mentioned in the descriptions of 
the places allows you to find hidden objects and important information. By 
speaking with the other characters you can know what you have to do to obtain 
their help.

- My little dear one, something is rotten in the House of Pudlo. -

His voice rings somehow out of synch with the movements of his mouth and jaw. 
The impression of artificiality is reinforced by his unblinking eyes in which 
you see your miniature reflection, as if looking in the reversed end of a 
telescope.

- You must revenge my foul and most unnatural murder! -

- Murder? - you exclaim. He beckons you to silence. - Yes, my dear boy, that 
shameless, that adulterate beast known to you as "Mother" has murdered me in 
connivance with Jacek, with whom she has been indulging in fornication since 
Shabbat Shekalim. -

It is time for your weekly Go lesson. You have been coming to your teacher's 
home for the past six months and though she isn't extravagant with her praise, 
you feel that your game is improving. 

Smiling inwardly, you remember your teacher's words the last time you called Go 
a 'game'. "A 'game'!" she said. "Go is not just a game - it is a reflection of 
your inner self!" 

But you sense that something is wrong: your teacher doesn't answer your knock, 
and in fact the front door is unlocked. Curious, you step inside...

Living Room
The living room is tastefully decorated. The furniture is arranged to make 
maximum use of the limited space. A bookshelf takes up one wall, while a sofa 
and end table are pushed up against another. Directly across from the sofa is a 
television.

On your last visit, a large wooden Go board occupied the space between the sofa 
and the TV, but now it's missing. The only thing left in its place are a pair 
of wooden Go bowls.

The front door is to the north, the kitchen is east and the bedroom lies to the 
south.

                           MUSE: An Autumn Romance

                        [Please press SPACE to begin.]
[ And though the shadow of a sigh
    May tremble through the story,
  For 'happy summer days' gone by,
    And vanish'd summer glory --
  It shall not touch with breath of bale
  The pleasance of our fairy-tale.
  
            - Lewis Carroll,
            "Through the Looking Glass"]

The late summer of 1886 found me on the continent for the purpose of regaining 
my health and spirits. These had been in decline for the past few months, and 
it was Dr Thorne's suggestion that the best cure for me might be a change of 
scenery. A short stay in Ramsgate, perhaps. Or better yet, a visit to the Alps 
in France or Switzerland, where the fresh mountain air would do me no end of 
good. 

I had declined at first to do any such thing. I was, after all, a staid, solid 
clergyman of 59 years, mature enough to weather any foolish fluctuations of 
temper. Besides which, these frivolities cost money. 

The doctor's recommendation eventually reached the ears of my dear sister Emma, 
however, and she immediately took up the task of convincing me of the necessity 
of such a trip. But it was not until I obtained news about relatively 
inexpensive alpine destinations that I relented, and found myself packed off to 
the continent for a month. 

The month's sojourn improved my health tremendously. However, without the 
distraction of my usual work, I found the mountains did little to raise my 
spirits. And so I made my journey homeward in a state of mute distraction, even 
as the first brilliance of Autumn began to make itself known among the trees. 

All in all, it had been a smooth and uneventful trip, but for a slight pause at 
the channel. This was at a small French coastal village from which I chose to 
make my crossing, it being less expensive than the usual ferry at Calais. Here 
I stopped for a meal at the local inn, and then waited as my trunk was 
transferred from the train to pier where the boatman was waiting. 

It was only a minor pause....

Pier
The pier stretched out into the cold waters of the English Channel from the 
village east of here. Overhead, I could hear the gulls swoop and cry. The brisk 
seaside air blew in my face, carrying with it the scent of salt. Far away, 
across the waves, the white cliffs of Dover could barely be seen in the grey 
clouded light.

My trusty old steamer trunk lay here.

A fishing boat was moored beside the pier and its boatman was waiting.

"Twenty-three dollars," he's saying. "Twenty-three dollars for the best dream 
of your life."

You don't know his name or anything -- he's just the guy you always meet at 
parties thrown by people you've never met. He's nobody's friend, exactly, but 
everyone knows who he is when it's time. Probably doesn't even have a name, 
probably has bagged groceries at some godforsaken Shopper's Food Warehouse 
since high school, but who cares? He's here to help you in your hour of need.

"What do you say?" he asks, holding up a repurposed cough syrup bottle with 
something green inside. Green like candy almost never is.

Stuck in an Attic
Sure, you're used to piece-of-shit architecture (you live in Dundalk, for 
crissake), but this place will be receiving some kind of award from you by the 
end of the night. There's totally unimportant crap strewn all over the place -- 
old sewing machines, an Easy-Bake oven, even a set of folding chairs painted 
carnival blue -- but fortunately, almost all of it is in shadow thanks to an 
underperforming fifty-watt bulb directly above.

It's just you and the dude here. The only place in the entire house you could 
get any privacy. It's only ten o'clock and already the call to hook up has come 
down from the heavens.

Stairs lead downward, back to the party and that awful trance-bop they keep 
playing.

>
Hunh?

>no
Now technically speaking, you have a great deal of free will during this story, 
so you're allowed to call it a night here and now.

You can go ahead and go downstairs if you want to -- surely there's something 
interesting going on in this party. Maybe there's a pretty girl with long 
blonde hair you bump into and end up hooking up with. You won't remember 
whether her name is Alice or Alicia, so you'll bail the next morning without a 
word.

It's okay. You won't see her ever again. And it all happens again the next 
weekend, and the weekend after that, too.

So it's okay if you want to say no to the whole thing.

In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy

You glance at the people who are in light colored clothes and look somewhat

The Town Square
You are standing in the middle of a pretty town square in the center of a 
nondescript New England town.  Like most any other nondescript New England 
towns, there's not much to see or do here, but maybe you'll find something 
amusing and enjoyable to do.

A shiny metal phone booth sits in the center of the square.

You came for quietude and serenity - a break from the pressures of being 
constantly in the public eye. You came for a spiritual retreat: a chance to be 
with your Father, to think about your future lessons, to meditate on the 
problems of the world. And what do you get? You get followed - followed by 
shepherdless sheep, all too eager to be impressed, but not so eager to 
understand! Your miracles never cease, and neither does the attention you get 
because of them. 

Yes, the world here is a hostile place at the best of times. Hunger, famine, 
poverty and uncleanliness are rife. The people are unhappy. The Romans have 
quashed religion: the priests are corrupt and unholy. 

With the power of God inherently vested in you, only you can save the day. 
Up-and-coming leader of the people (and a new religion to boot), your followers 
have... well, followed you! They are weary from the journey and hungry too, but 
being so numerous, it seems only a miracle could possibly feed them all...

Edge Of Meadow
The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer afternoon. A 
stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old wooden bridge stretches 
across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a scrubby hillside stretches upward.

The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are pleasantly far 
off to the west.

The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.

Stream Bank
A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge which 
spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the east rises the 
flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight; two usable trails lead up 
around it, to the south and the northeast.

This very short interactive fiction game is only an experiment that is born 
from the question: "How many  adventurous ideas and puzzles can be drawn from 
some passages of a literature masterpiece?" 
Which hints, which ideas, to be more precise, can be taken from the Ninth Book 
of the Odissey, the chapter that narrates the famous adventure of Ulysses and 
the Cyclops? Let's see. 

Note: much of the text is taken from Robert Fagles' translation of the Odissey, 
published by Viking Penguin.

But secret I revolved the deep design: 'Twas for our lives my labouring bosom 
wrought; Each scheme I turn'd, and sharpen'd every thought; This way and that I 
cast to save my friends, Till one resolve my varying counsel ends.

Homer, Odissey, Book IXn

The Cyclops cave 
"But round the grot we gaze; and all we view, in order ranged our admiration 
drew: the bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd, the folded flocks each 
separate from the rest in pens (the larger here, and there the lesser lambs in 
fence, the new-fallen young here bleating for their dams: the kid distinguish'd 
from the lambkin lies); the cavern echoes with responsive cries. Capacious 
chargers all around were laid. Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade. 
With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store my friends advise me, and to 
quit the shore. Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away, consult our safety, 
and put off to sea. In the cavern, warmt by fire, dust is everywhere, even near 
the great mat of bands, bed of the monster".

Near half a forest on his back he bore, and cast the ponderous burden at the 
door. It thunder'd as it fell. We trembled then, and sought the deep recesses 
of the den. New driven before him through the arching rock, came tumbling, 
heaps on heaps, the unnumber'd flock.

A big rock blocks the entrance of the cave.

In the middle of the cavern there is a beautiful ram, the leader of the flocks.

Your faithful men are here, around you.

Welcome to Paranoia!

HOW TO PLAY

Very occasionally during this adventure, you will be given a choice of things 
to do. Always choose the least dangerous option. Continue doing this until you 
win. At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and will be informed of 
the outcome. These sections will be self explanatory. There are a few other 
commands you can use -- type 'help' to find out about them.

HOW TO DIE

As Philo-R-DMD, you will die several times during the adventure. A new clone 
will be activated to take the place of the one that died, in a different 
location. The new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old 
Philo-R's path; hopefully he won't make the same mistakes as his predecessor.

HOW TO WIN

Simply complete the mission before expending all six of your clones. 
Remember... stay alert, and keep your laser handy.

You are standing on a steep sided hill. Behind you to the east is a range of 
mountains trapping the city against the sea. In front of you would once have 
been a forested plain stretching down to the sparkling sea. You can imagine the 
first humans to see this place, standing on the hilltop, the ancestors of this 
great city in front. You feel a sense of kinship with that ancient people, as 
you stand knowing that you will be the last person to see this now 
metropolised, cultivated plain.

Hilltop
You look across a city to the sea on the far side. A silent city. The hilltop 
itself is barren of trees, although the steep slopes around are wooded. You 
must be standing a good forty or fifty metres above the city below.

Life on Gue Street.

I highly suggest typing "About" if this is your first time playing this.

The little, invaluable self-deceptions we allow ourselves. Sometimes they're 
the only things that make adventuring bearable. Today, for example, you're 
taking a walk on Gue Street beneath a cloudless summer sky. Not surprising; 
you've been adventuring around this neighborhood almost every day to enjoy the 
warm weather and plentiful treasure. You've walked down this street, and dozens 
identical to it all across Quendor, countless times, reveling in the little 
details, taking an adventurer's pleasure in noting how the whole architecture 
of the game seems to change based on what you type. The placement of a single 
"N" or "Kill Troll" or the calibrated timing of a child's laugh, the most 
random of events, combine like a catalyst with your emotions such that the 
street never appears quite the same. It is therefore completely plausible, you 
tell yourself repeatedly, that this is just another daily adventure, that 
there's no special reason why you turned down this tiny lane rather than the 
next one. The fact that the White House, the unjustly enticing old, boarded up, 
cozy, bungalow is just down the street is a mere coincidence, nothing more.

 Type "1" to continue, "2" to turn back, or "No" to take a different path.

 Type "1" to continue, "2" to turn back, or "No" to take a different path.
no

You walk around the White House and let yourself in through an open window. A 
quick walk into the living room reveals a sword of apparent Elvish origin, and 
a great lamp. This walk on Gue street, which started out so introspectively, 
may already be paying off. In an contemplative mood, you examine the oriental 
rug in the living room to make sure it isn't the product of child labor. In 
doing so, while remembering your many adventures past, you discover a trap 
door. You are a self-respecting adventurer, despite what Pat said, so you open 
it and descend.

"This game was conceived of and fully outlined in early June of 1999."

And it was, too. All that discussion of compassless games, and mazes, and 
whether "Hunt the Wumpus" was really IF, made me giggle. I already had this on 
the drawing board. I didn't start any of that discussion, either -- although I 
contributed a few comments that I knew would turn out relevant.

Hunter, in Darkness came in eighth in the 1999 Interactive Fiction Competition. 
I might perhaps have done better if I'd included a walkthrough, or hints. Never 
know now, eh?

I'm not including hints now, because this is no longer a Competition game. 
Different strictures apply. You can easily find a walkthrough, or ask for help. 
However, I will say this:

No serious mapping is necessary, or even useful, in playing this game. If you 
think you need to start drawing a map, you're wrong.

When you saw the ugly little doll in the shop window you knew you had to have 
it. It would make a great addition to your collection of mysterious items and 
artifacts.

The doll stood only about a foot tall and seemed to be made of a tough leathery 
material. Its head was small and misshapen, and its long, razor-sharp teeth 
could be seen protruding from its mouth. It wore a little gold talisman around 
its neck and wielded a cute little six inch sword. The sign read "Genuine 
African Zuni Doll. Only $19.99"

After bringing it home and taking it out of the box you read the little 
information sheet that came with it.

                              "African Zuni Doll"

"It is said that the Zuni Doll is inhabited by the spirit of an African 
Tribesman who died while committing a cowardly act. In order to let the 
deceased regain his lost honor, the tribe's witch doctor imprisoned the man's 
spirit in a doll and a talisman that he created especially for that purpose. 
The spirit remains trapped until it atones for the cowardice the tribesman 
committed and proves its bravery. To accomplish this, the Zuni Doll must 
complete a near impossible task: hunt and kill, 25 human.

"Fortunately, the Zuni Doll is harmless as long as it continues to wear the 
gold talisman. The magic in the talisman keeps the Zuni Doll from coming to 
life and carrying out its mission of blood."

Now, you are lying in bed thinking of the little doll when you feel a slight 
pressure near your feet. Looking down you see your cat, Elmo, crawling towards 
you. You reach down and give Elmo a good scratch behind the ears. That is when 
you notice something small and golden drop from his mouth.

soft green rug and the walls are mostly bare except for a painting depicting a 
lush pastoral scene. A window set in one wall gives a beautiful view of the 
city. The main living room is to the east and your bathroom is to the south.

The bathroom door is open.

Beside the bed is a small wooden table.

On the table is an ornately decorated glass lamp.

A small golden Talisman lies in your lap where Elmo deposited it.

A clean white sheet is draped over the top of the bed.

Elmo is cureled up on the bed resting peacefully.

You crawl through the tight passageway, your lantern swinging in your hand, 
casting shadows that play about all around you.  Perhaps a human would be 
claustraphobic here, certainly one of the Elves would, but you are a Dwarven 
Reclaimer, sent to explore and prepare the abandoned city for the return of its 
people.  The ancient city awaits, just a little further up.  You shuffle 
farther in until you finally see the wooden doorway that brings a large bearded 
smile to your face.  You're there!  You have finally reached...

Secret Entrance
This is a rather dark and small room, having only two exits, back north the way 
you came, from the ancestral homes of Tana, or through the heavily barred 
wooden door before you that leads southwest and inward to the abandoned 
Deephome, abode of the Dwarves in Telleen.  It has been three hundred years 
since your people lived here.

The door blocks the way into the city of Deephome.

Bedroom (on the bed)
Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the rest of the 
house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room when you moved in. 
Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye for detail. Once or twice, 
she hinted that you have been insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but 
you do recognize the things of real practical value, like the calendar on the 
wall, at least!

Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room from 
here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite to the 
window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front of it.

On the nightstand, you can see your wallet.

Speeding down Montgomery Boulevard
The streetlights are bright. Unbearably bright. You have to squint as hard as 
you can to keep your retinas from bursting into flame.

"Welcome back to the land of the LIVING, bud," Rob says. "You planning to stick 
around for a while or you gonna pass out again? Cause one thing I've learned 
about chicks is that they actually DON'T LIKE IT when you pass out on them in 
the middle of gettin' it on. You hear me? So if that's, like, your PLAN, then 
I'm droppin' you off and showin' up solo."

You don't exactly remember where the day went, but as you listen to Rob rant 
on, bits of it start to float back to you: a day on the slopes, the brisk 
February wind against your face; polishing off a keg back at the lodge; those 
two girls you and Rob had hit it off with, the ones who'd given you their 
address in town. "We all should get together sometime!" they'd said. Of course, 
Rob insisted that by "sometime" they'd meant "later tonight." You hadn't been 
so sure, but then you'd blacked out before you could argue the point.

How Rob came to be driving your car you're not exactly sure. Apparently he 
couldn't wait till you were sober enough to drive it yourself. From the way 
he's weaving all over the road, he also apparently couldn't wait till HE was 
sober enough to drive it, either.

Rob changes the radio station a few times, eventually settling on the station 
you were listening to in the first place.

You came to Livadhia as a pilgrim, looking for Trophonius, for gods and lights. 
 A private consultation.

No luck: the Blue Guide is vague; the man on the street doesn't know what 
you're talking about; and when you tried the periptero where the bus from 
Athens comes to its lurching halt, the owner tried to sell you tickets to the 
Pythia.  "Just eight thousand drachs and no waiting in line!"  

As if the sort of advice you'd get at Delphi would help.  It's all a franchise 
now.

So you set off on your own.  It seemed hopeless, and perhaps it was.  But one 
mis-step in the thigh-deep leaves, and you ended here...

Peacock Chamber
A deep chamber walled in rock.  Light descends steeply from the oculus above, 
leaving a spot of elliptical brilliance on the dusty ground.  The walls are 
panelled, to a height just level with the knee: emerald, sapphire, ovals of 
amethyst, shadowed and dull.

There are two exits: one ceremonial, the vast lintel capped with a triangle of 
empty space, which leads south; the other low and secretive, leading east.

On the altar is a pair of pinking shears.

A heavy metal box has been shoved up against the wall, almost out of sight.

of his presence, and step inside, stopping before the owner of the familiar, 
frowning face just inside. Your escorts come to a halt behind you.

"Tolan," the tall, wiry woman says to you.

You steel yourself for the need to speak. "Cheryl," you reply. "Dig Leader 
Cheryl Thadafel. I knew you would have need of the greatest Mechanist in the 
galaxy. Again." The longest speech ever to cross these lips?

"Tolan, this is going to be on my terms, or not at all."

You turn your empty hands face-up. "Cheryl, this is important to me. It is the Yi-Lono-Mordel
. Whatever the restrictions, I cannot miss this opportunity."

"Especially if the restrictions required you be kept away from it. Enough. I 
don't have much else to work with here, do I?" As she dismisses the guards, you 
sweep your eyes about the room.

Again.

This time you will pull it off--regardless of Cheryl's desires.

Yi-Lono-Mordel Control Room
Most humans would probably find it the height of fashion, but this low 
ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and 
sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical 
window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A 
cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor.

Cheryl Thadafel stands here, watching you closely.

You have recently lived in Toronto but then your parents moved away. You really 
loved them. But, you were kidnapped and locked in this house. Those kidnappers 
really should be put in jail.

Well, you don't want to stay here any longer than you can help. You want to get 
to school on this Saturday to see your grade nine pals. And last night you were 
shoved in this house. As you wake up, you realise...

                          [Please press any key to begin.]

... that you are all alone in a locked bedroom, and you need to find a way out.

Bedroom
This bedroom is a medium-sized room, with an ugly flower wallpaper. A dresser 
sits in an awkward corner. An entrance to a small bathroom is to the west while 
the door to the main corridor to the east. A cheap window sits at one side. A 
trapdoor in the ceiling seems to lead up to an attic, although high up.

The door to the hallway is currently closed.

The trapdoor is closed, blocking the way into the attic.

A mahogany double dresser sits here. In the dresser, there are no open drawers.

You can also see a wall clock, a night-table (on which are an air freshener and 
a lamp) and a bed (on which are some sheets) here.

Attack of the Yeti Robot Zombies
This is a try-to-win-on-the-first-attempt game. The point of the game is to try 
to win on the first attempt. Or, failing that, to win in as few attempts as 
possible. You are not supposed to use "undo" or "restore" if things are going 
badly. (Though it is OK to use "save" and then later "restore" if you have to 
leave the game for a while. And it is OK to save the game as often as you 
like.)
Get it? Yes or no?

Please answer yes or no.> no

Ok, I will give an example. Say you are playing a game where you start in a 
burning building. If this were a normal game maybe you would want to search the 
building. Maybe you would find things. If you died you could just restart. But 
if you where playing a try-to-win-on-the-first-attempt game, you would probably 
want to run out, otherwise you might burn and die and then you would probably 
not win on the first attempt.
Now do you understand? Yes or no?

Doctor Proctor Phillips has been bothering the world for quite a long time now.

First came the infamous Rabbits' Attacks, then the Tortoise Kamikadzes, and 
after that - The Mouse Terrorists...

Everyone agreed something had to be done about it, but no-one knew what - 
that's where you came in.

You, Anthony Amerbach, one of the most extravagant agents the world had ever 
known. You don't have the charisma of James Bond or even the humour of Nick 
Pirandello, in fact, you look as ugly as ten drunken goblins and speak like 
someone who just inhaled too much cocaine.

But you do have one strength - you love the extraordinary... And this Proctor 
turned out to be the most extraordinary guy FBI has ever faced (much worse than 
the infamous cannibalistic doctor).

So you were told to go to Proctor's secret hideout... Surprisingly enough, you 
not only found out its location in a pretty ordinary Chinese atlas (sold only 
in Krasnoyarsk), you also got there without much problems (ten battleships and 
five submarines shooting torpedoes don't count).

The beach
You're standing on a beach... Once it was famous among sunbathers for its 
unique location - only here you can get a tan in ten minutes - but then Doctor 
Proctor arrived, built an ugly tower, created some monsters, and - all the rest 
is pretty usual - banned alcohol. This the celebrities couldn't take! That's 
why the area is empty...

From the east you can hear noices usually heard in the zoos' apes sections.

Some monsters are visible west from the beach.

Your boat sits in the water.

Your gun lies on the sand.

looted the fortress of Fyleet and took its treasures into

Summer on a college campus is rarely exciting, and this year is no exception. 
Your fellow students won't be returning for three more weeks, and the endless 
grind of your job at the computer center is not anyone's idea of entertainment.

Yesterday was the first of September, and autumn is moving in. But the long 
drag of classes won't start for weeks. Restless would be one way to describe 
your mood; bored sick would be another.

Last night, you had odd dreams: a circle, turning endlessly, and carrying you 
on its back across strange lands; yourself grown double, and dueling with 
cold-blazing swords; and others, stranger yet.

Then the alarm went off, and you emerged into another mundane day. Maybe 
something will come along to entertain you....

You are finally at home. Those parties at Stifler's always drive your stomach 
mad. Drinks of all kind, kindly mixed by Slacks, the favourite barkeeper. With 
those drinks, it's always the same bad thing: At least 60% alcohol, rest either 
alcohol or some alcoholic beverage. Only food served: chips. chili chips. 
Lighting farts is one of your favourite hobbys at these events. But sometimes, 
some 'hardware' finally presses down your guts to reach fresh air. Then, always 
around four in the morning, it's time to go home. Luckily, your one room 
apartement isn't far away from stifler's, so you get here after about five

You eye around the walls and get hold of the other ingredients for your thing

next to it tries to keep it's door closed in spite of the enormous pressure 
resulting in at least four different chemical reactions taking place in there. 
Before the fridge, an old cupboard catches dust. This is your home, though, and

You're Tracy Valencia, first-year student at the reasonably prestigious 
University of Dorado. Sure, it's not Berkeley -- hell, it isn't even Stanford 
-- but it's light-years better than Dorado State, where your older brother 
Trevor goes. Dorado State's just a party school. Trevor makes a point of 
rubbing this in every time he calls.

He'll be able to rub it in in person soon enough: it's Thanksgiving Day, and 
you're driving home. Daddy was perfectly willing to buy you a plane ticket, but 
like you told him on the phone, there are much better things to spend the money 
on. Birthday presents, for instance -- you turn eighteen tomorrow. Besides, 
it's only a four-hour drive.

Two and a half hours into said drive, the car starts making a noise no piece of 
machinery should ever make. It's the sort of sound a rhesus monkey might make 
being forced down a garbage disposal. Now, Dorado is nothing but scorching 
desert from the time you cross the coastal mountains until you reach the river; 
true, it's the scorching desert in which you grew up, but sentimentality aside, 
it's not exactly the best place in the world to find yourself stranded. But 
you've got to do something about this noise, if only because it's drowning out 
the stereo. So you pull over. You're just about to switch off the ignition when 
the car goes dead of its own accord. You try to start it up again, but 
absolutely nothing happens.

Guess what, Tracy? You're stuck on the loneliest stretch of Interstate Zero 
miles away from the last sign of civilization. It's twenty minutes to noon and 
the temperature's well over a hundred and twenty. You already miss the air 
conditioning. It's beginning to look like Ed and Sandy Valencia's only daughter 
might not make it for Thanksgiving dinner...

It is late afternoon, and the previously busy market place now has only a few 
stragglers trying to find last-minute bargains.
 Your stall is now devoid of all the home-grown delights that were piled on the 
table, and you are preparing to pack things away and return to your house.
It seems that Giles, next stall along, (for whom you have a secret fondness,) 
has also had a good day.  He stands, with the last remaining apple tree sapling 
that he has left for sale.
 You look shyly towards him, but all his attention is taken up gazing at Grace, 
the beautiful daughter of the local squire who approaches Giles' stall.

Hardly sparing a glance at the tree she throws some money at Giles' feet and 
instructs him to deliver it immediately to the Hall. 
 She sweeps away with a wiggle and a show of shapely leg below her silk gown, 
and Giles trots along obediently behind her like a faithful dog.

The Market Square
The market place has stalls arranged around its perimeter.    
The north side of the square is bordered by the entrance gate and boundary wall 
of the Hall, the squire's residence.
Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail leads to 
the west.
The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is far too 
distant to walk to.  

It's the end of the day and there is little left to buy, and few people still 
browsing.

"Is this alright?" asks the young cop. "Do you need the lights lower, or 
incense, or something?"

"This is fine. I just need to see him, ask some questions."

"Okay," he nods. "Just buzz the buzzer when you're done." He leaves, pulling 
the metal door to with the click of a magnetic lock. Across the table from you 
the man stiffens, waiting for you to speak.

Interview Room
The six walls are metal. This is a box in which nothing happens but people 
talk, and fans whir air in and out to help the words move along. By the door in 
the north wall is a small red button that rings the buzzer for the guard, and 
it's smart enough to know who's pushing. This isn't a place people leave of 
their own accord, and they rarely come here that way either.

The man across the table from you is no different. His eyes are sagging from 
lack of sleep, and he is sweating just a little even though the air is

Burly Mountain isn't the biggest of the big mountains. Hell, it's not even the 
biggest of the smaller mountains. It's really not that tough a climb at all, 
considering. But being the rich, young, egocentric, expert bragger Gary 
Hikerson, you'll be happy to pretend it was. That is, once you get back down 
safely, of course.

Yes indeed, you've never been one to let any obstacle stand in the way of your 
prospective fame. Well, that was until you found yourself standing at the foot 
of this dirty great big mountain that you haven't even begun to climb...

Conan is ready for revenge - he will KILL EVERYTHING!

Dungeon
Conan is in a damp dungeon, furnished only with an oaken table. The walls

door, leading north, is closed. 

Weazle, the evil wizard spins around as Conan enters the room.

"Ha!", he cries, "here comes stupid Conan whose parents I killed, whose sister 
I sold to the orks and whose dumbbells I stole! You want revenge! But you will 
perish!" 

He taps his pointed hat, and a growling wildcat appears out of thin air!

It's a clear summer night in London.  You walk purposefully down Langley Street 
in Covent Garden looking for the pub.  It's nearly time and you can't be late.  
Tonight is the most important night of your life.  Ah! Here's the pub! You 
enter and walk directly to the bar, weaving in and around throngs of patrons 
happy to be enjoying a drink after a day's work.  You approach the bartender 
and inquire. You were told to speak to Nigel.  The bartender confirms he is 
Nigel and he asks your business.  You give him the reply just as you were told. 
 He nods his head solemnly and asks you to follow him.

He leads you to a door towards the back of the bustling pub. He gives the door 
two sharp knocks, pauses for three seconds then two more sharp knocks.  A regal 
voice from behind the door simply says "Enter!".  With that, Nigel hurriedly 
backs away and turns tail to resume simpler, safer duties tending bar.  You 
enter the room dutifully and close the door behind you.  Looking around you are 
deeply impressed with the furnishings.  Lots of red cloth, leather couches and 
recliners, the heavy smoke of cigars and the presence of just three men.  You 
know you are in the presence of true masters of their craft.  One of the men 
you recognize as your mentor, Simon.  The other two gentlemen you haven't met 
before.

The youngest man, perhaps 25 years old at best, rises and looks you over.  "I 
am the Grand Bastard." He has an unmistakable British accent. "Who sponsors 
this apprentice bastard?", indicating you. Your mentor rises and claims 
responsbility for the sponsorship. "Very well, let the trials begin.  I shall 
go first."

"An utterly clueless network user calls and asks you why the network is running 
so slow.  What is your response?"

"I cheerfully volunteer to immediately inspect the co-worker's computer, 
diagnose the problem and repair it." With this, you can see the Grand Bastard 
is greatly offended.  Undaunted, you continue..." I get under their desk, open 
the computer case and swap out the 100 megabit network card and replace it with 
a 300 baud modem with the speaker disabled.  I close the computer cover, plug 
the modem into a phone line, boot up the computer and make lightning-fast 
configuration changes the user can't follow.  When I'm all done their 100 
megabit per second connection is reduced to a 300 bit per second connection via 
demand-dial connectivity.  Without a doubt, they will never call me and 
complain again."

You wait breathlessly for the reaction of The Grand Bastard.  "That is an 
excellent solution.  You have passed my trial." Looking around at his two peers 
he continues, "Indeed, your response is so thorough, so diabolical and so 
effective I think we can dispense with the remaining trials.  Are we agreed?" 
Your mentor and the other BOFH both nod their assent.

"Then it is done.  I confer upon thee the formal title of Bastard Operator from 
Hell.  Return to the United States of America and do us proud.  Now.  Go! Begin 
thy tenure!"

Mission Control
Your office, where you carry out your Bastardly duties, is equipped with the 
finest furnishings and equipment necessary to perform your work.  As you have 
an aversion to cheap kit, your desk is the finest example of office furniture 
ever bestowed upon the human race.  Sitting atop this monument to furniture is 
the single most powerful computer in the company; your personal workstation.  
Only two decorations adorn the walls; a Bill Gatus of Borg poster and a daily 
calendar.  North leads out of Mission Control to other, less important areas 
while you spot a very large and serious looking door down the hall just east.

On the desk are an inbox (in which is a note from your boss) and an outbox 
(which is empty).

You can see an Armageddon-proof safe (which is closed) and Dave's Toshiba 
laptop here.

digital cell. Normally the Kaden would already be at work analyzing your mind 
to run the loyalty transfer program, but you haven't felt anything at all in 
the last five hours. The delay is unnerving, since the mind can survive in 
virtual space for a limited amount of time before it destroys itself. Your 
companions, the Souden, should be close to beginning the assault now, although 
since they know nothing of your predicament survival is still doubtful.

Running down a long featureless white corridor not knowing from who or what you 
experience a great sense of urgency and panic. Dressed in nothing but a white 
hospital robe, a shudder runs down your spine as you feel thin fingers reaching 
out to grab you. A voice calls out, "You have one minute to reach minimum safe 
distance," followed by the distant sound of an explosion.

You round a corner and stop short. Panic rises in your heart as you face a 
horrible drooling man wielding an axe. Before you can turn to flee he dissolves 
into another man clad in a white doctor's coat and wearing a stethoscope around 
his neck. He speaks a word that sounds like, "Spivey."  He suddenly lunges for 
you! You turn to flee...

No longer in the featureless hallway, you find yourself in some kind of 
laboratory. The hum of great machinery is all around you. An odd sensation near 
your head makes you realize that your hair has grown long and stringy. An itchy 
sensation in your chest catches your attention and you discover that you are no 
longer wearing the white robe. Instead you are attired in a turtle neck sweater 
and bell bottoms. A nearby terminal beeps an alarm. Reams of ticker tape begin 
to spew output onto the floor. The Program some how feels familiar.

A noise from behind you catches your attention. Two men dressed in dark suits 
and glasses enter the room. An ominous and hunched shadow looms in the doorway 
behind them lurking on the edge of sight. The sense of fear and urgency 
returns. The men draw guns from within their coats. You have nowhere to run...

                                     -BANG-

You sit up in your bed. Your eyes refuse to focus on the great commotion about 
you. Someone calls your name. Someone else has kicked your door in. Three 
people are in your room and before you can react one of them is on you. He 
rolls you to the ground and secures your hands behind your back. Your name is 
called again. The voice is that of your roommate John. The other two figures 
have bound him with duct tape and are carrying him from the room.

Lightning flashes! You see the ominous shadow of a hunched figure peering in 
through the panes of your window. A short sharp pain shoots through the back of 
your head and all goes black and silent...

Odd, how the light just makes your apartment gloomier. Pre-dawn darkness pools 
in the corners and around the tops of walls. Your desk lamp glares yellow, but 
the shadows only draw your eyes and deepen.

Not much of an apartment, no. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty computer 
shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on a cardboard 
crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the other, with a closet to 
the side. A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it 
halfway works. One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

Your luggage is piled untidily by the door. A potted hyacinth sits beneath the 
window.

You are sprawled on the futon, staring up into that gloom. Your eyes feel 
gritty. But it's too late -- early -- no time left for sleep, anyway. In a few 
hours your ride will arrive.

On the desk are your to-do list and a travel book.

This is the center, apparently. The planes of existence stretch out around you;

 plane; the plane of structure; the plane of shape; and the plane of essence.

A Desperate Battle
Copyright (C) 2006 by Eric Eve
Release 1 / Serial number 060422 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11 

Your horse went lame five miles back, so you had to leave him at some peasant's 
farm and continue the journey on foot. It would have been tempting to rest 
awhile, accepting the peasant's rustic hospitality, but the king's orders were 
explicit - make for Swineback Ridge with the minimum of delay. Weary though you 
are from battling against rebels in the east, the king insisted that he needs you
 here, to take command of the hopelessly outnumbered army up on the ridge 
ahead, an army that's your homeland's last, best hope to turn back the 
barbarian hordes and avoid the fall of night.

For the tenth time today you wonder about the urgency. The last you heard 
General Chorza was in command of the army up on the ridge, and you know Chorza 
of old, a fine soldier and a good commander. So what is it that Chorza cannot 
handle himself?

Dusty Path
The long dusty path leads through untended fields up towards Swineback Ridge to 
the north.  To the south it leads back into the heartlands of the Kingdom of 
Lorayne, the land you are determined to defend at all costs against the 
barbarian hordes of the Phartipu. A narrow lane leads off across the fields to 
the east.

Wizard's Castle game from July/August 1980 issue of Recreational Computing 
magazine

Written for Exidy Sorceror by Joseph R. Power

Modified for Heath Microsoft BASIC by J. F. Stetson

Rewritten for Graham Nelson's Inform by Adam Biltcliffe with help from the 
folks on ifMUD.

Do you want to play in Classic mode, Normal mode, Statistician mode or 
Cartographer mode?

Classic mode is as close as possible to the original text, including typos and 
miscellaneous ugliness. If you're not on a nostalgia trip, normal mode contains 
less typos and presents a few things (such as the final game summary) in a 
slightly neater way. Statistician mode is similar to normal mode but uses the 
status line to display your attributes and equipment instead of printing them 
out at the start of each turn. Cartographer mode ('m'ap mode) uses the status 
line to display a map of the current dungeon level.

The other notable difference is in the coordinate systems. In the original 
game, the 'x' axis was the vertical axis, and the 'y' axis the horizontal. All 
the new versions use the normally-accepted axes. This change manifests itself 
only in the displaying of coordinates and in teleporting, so the only thing to 
bear in mind is that whichever mode you are playing in, you simply need to 
enter the coordinates when teleporting in the same order as they are printed.

Do you want to play in Classic mode, Normal mode, Statistician mode or 
Cartographer mode?

Classic mode is as close as possible to the original text, including typos and 
miscellaneous ugliness. If you're not on a nostalgia trip, normal mode contains 
less typos and presents a few things (such as the final game summary) in a 
slightly neater way. Statistician mode is similar to normal mode but uses the 
status line to display your attributes and equipment instead of printing them 
out at the start of each turn. Cartographer mode ('m'ap mode) uses the status 
line to display a map of the current dungeon level.

The other notable difference is in the coordinate systems. In the original 
game, the 'x' axis was the vertical axis, and the 'y' axis the horizontal. All 
the new versions use the normally-accepted axes. This change manifests itself 
only in the displaying of coordinates and in teleporting, so the only thing to 
bear in mind is that whichever mode you are playing in, you simply need to 
enter the coordinates when teleporting in the same order as they are printed.

PREFACE

Somewhere in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, lies a barn, constructed by Amish 
such as yourself, because everyone needs a barn.

PROLOGUE

You are outside that barn in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, doing your normal 
routine, free from the depravity of the Englisch. But your adventurous spirit 
continues to drive your heart to the dangers and perils that spawn from 
adventure, and wearing buttons.

INTRODUCTION

In AMISHVILLE, you play the role of a normal Amish householder, living your 
life in your hometown with your fellow Plain People.

Outside the Barn

ACT I

Lancaster County, Pennsylvania

You are outside your barn, having just parked your buggy inside and stabled the 
horses. You brush the dust off the brim of your straw hat, loosen two of the 
hooks of your coat, and stroke your beard thoughtfully. Your adventurous spirit 
is tugging at you. Perhaps you shouldn't return to your home just yet.

>no
Suddenly you realize that you're opposed to the use of electrically powered 
appliances such as computers.

It is a very strange time and place you find yourself in.

Earth. North America. Early 1998.

From readily available information, and the pronounced fears of a few 
politicians and information technology leaders, it is obvious to you that 
things are about to fall apart. Yet the world at large seems blissfully 
ignorant. Most citizens pay little attention to history and are unfamiliar with 
how unusually blessed latter-20th-century North Americans have been. 

Peace. Prosperity. We live for entertainment, money, and immediate 
gratification. 

Most people seem unwilling to believe that the geniuses who've given us all the 
technology we take for granted could possibly have painted us all into a corner 
with the Year 2000 century change problem, also known as the "Millennium Bomb" 
or "Y2K". 

On the other hand, a small but rapidly growing percentage of people - mostly 
information workers with above-average intelligence - are already predicting 
the breakdown of banks, stock markets, aviation, public utilities, ... maybe 
even society itself. 

You are an employee of Biritzcom. It is early 1998. Since this is the demo 
version, there is a demo fairy flitting about your head, limiting your 
experimentation to 20 moves for each of Uh-Oh!'s 5 phases. 

(To order the full version, use the ORDERING command.) 

I suggest you examine your computer ...

Crypt (in the coffin)
Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your immortal 
body for centuries, while your foolish enemies spent their miserable days 
hunting for you in your castle. The coffin is on a stone pedestal at the centre 
of the room. On the ceiling is a fresco of the red sun of Valmar. To the east a 
narrow tunnel leads to the other rooms of your lair.

You're lying in the coffin, very weak. You struggle to keep your eyes open, 
while your necrotic flesh recovers its former appearance. You feel a stab of 
pain as you remember the stake that was driven through your heart. You should 
be dead, but you aren't. Something happened.

On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and 
grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains 
were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with squat 
brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic 
charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks below tenements 
-- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley can conceal 
balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers 
nurtured by who knows who.

This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty brick, and 
you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a handle. 
Maybe you should call it a day.

It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in three

Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of the 
breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia. As if she 
weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their breast-plates red in the 
setting sun, march ahead of the procession and protect you from seeing anything 
unrehearsed. It's a dog's life being an Ambassador.

Watling Street (in the cushioned basket)
The ancient paved road stretches for miles to the south, turning very slowly to 
the northeast along a mossy stone wall. From up here on your elephant's 
wickerwork basket, you're just level with the branches of the old Imperial 
hunting woods inside the wall.

Having been stuck in this cushioned basket with the Lady Amilia every day for a 
fortnight, you're just desperate to get away.

The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping onto the 
flagstones with a dull, regular boom.

In a secret base far underneath Washington DC, decisions are made. Decisions 
that can - and will - affect the entire world. This is the base of the Special 
Secret Service, a worldwide organisation outside of petty international 
disputes, assigned to protect our planet at whatever cost from those things the 
general public are better off being ignorant of. On this particular day, a 
collection of the most important and least known people on the planet sat 
around the huge varnished conference table. 

 "OK," said Agent Llewellyn, opening the first of many boxes. "Who wants the 
Meat Feast?" 

 "Me," said Agent Yahtzee, putting his colt .357 back into his belt. 

 "What?!" piped up Agent Garrison. "Why should you get first choice?" 

 "It's quite simple, Chris," retorted Agent Yahtzee. "Whoever shoots the 
delivery boy first gets to choose first. It's the way it's always been." 

 Chris Garrison stared down his fellow crusader. "Arthur, you ALWAYS get first 
choice! No-one else regularly brings a gun to the meetings!" 

 Agent Pemberton, stood on the podium, took the silence as an opportunity to 
chip in. "If we can get back to the matter at hand, ladies and gentlemen, the 
Earth is facing horrid catastrophe once again." The assembled agents relaxed. 
They knew where they stood with horrid catastrophe. Robert Pemberton continued. 
"You-know-who is at it again. You-know-who has devised a way to travel back to 
his own dimension. Who am I talking about?" 

 Like bored teenagers watching a holiday camp entertainer with withering 
contempt, the agents chanted in unison, "Doctor Diablo." 

 Dr. Diablo was a sadist. One of the most twisted, evil sadists the multiverse 
has ever known. He came to this dimension after an accident in his own research 
laboratory which was, although a relief to the Special Secret Service of that 
universe, a pain in the arse for the SSS of this universe. Dr. Diablo's 
ultimate quest was to annihilate everyone in the human race but himself, but if 
he destroyed the Earth - as he is more than capable of - then, obviously, he 
would also die. Only when he had a certain pathway to another dimension would 
he set the timer for the Apocalypse Bomb, which was why the SSS endeavoured 
almost constantly to keep him in this universe. He was just that little bit 
less dangerous over here than over there. 

 "What master plan has he hatched this time?" inquired Agent Kastanet, 
twiddling with her ID tags. 

 "He means to use the mystical powers of a certain artefact, the location of 
which has been known to us for many decades now." 

 "You don't mean..." began Agent Llewellyn. 

    "... Hell's Cheesecake?" finished everyone else. 

 "The very same," said Agent Pemberton smugly. "As you know, the security in 
the Temple of Hell's Cheesecake is so tight that only one of us can get 
through, but as you know Diablo is a resourceful one. One of us will have to go 
to the temple and fetch the Cheesecake back here before Diablo gets there 
first." 

 "Who?" 

 "Who else? The only one of us who has skived off all his assigned missions for 
the last six months, and just sits on his arse all day stuffing his face with 
pizza?" 

 Agent Arthur Yahtzee looked up from his meal, pepperoni smeared over his face, 
and said, "Why's everyone staring at me?"

Temple of Hell's Cheesecake
After numerous adventures you have penetrated the very centre of the Temple, to 
this tiny little vault where the cursed dessert lies. The room is small and 
unordained, unlike the rest of the temple, with just crumbly yellow bricks 
forming the walls and concrete making up the floor and ceiling. The exit door 
is to the south and the centre of the room is dominated by a cylindrical 
podium.

On the podium is the cheesecake of Beezlebub.

Foyer
This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper is 
peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and there. There 
is a stairway, stable enough to ascend. The big area to the west must have once 
been a separate room, but the demolition crew seems to have already taken out a 
wall. A living room is east. On the south side is the front door. A Dumpster 
has been dumped here.

The contractor clears his throat and points at the big Dumpster. "Forget the 
fixtures, but pick up everything that's not bolted down, including the stuff 
out back. Then, drop off all the debris - er, I mean, um, treasures - right 
here ..." He scrawls something on the Dumpster with a marker. "Good luck!" The 
contractor hurries out the front door, which slams closed, leaving you alone.

You spot a door to the north, leading out back. It is shut quite tight.

It has been a fierce battle, full of bold moves, daring attacks, surprising 
gambits and heroic sacrifices. Throughout this, you've remained at your 
starting point, patiently waiting for orders. But now that the metaphorical 
dust has settled and most pieces have been exchanged, it finally looks as if it 
is your turn. The White King and one of your Pawn colleagues have managed to 
nail the Black King with his back to the edge of the board, but they can't 
finish him off without help.

The White King calls you to action. It is time to make your move.

This is the place you have lived in for the last month and a bit. It was all 
you could afford with the small pay you gleaned from countless rubbish jobs. 
Looking back, you should have looked harder. The walls are unpapered, the floor 
uncarpeted, and the room itself only contains a narrow, hard bed, a dresser and 
a small television. The front door is to the west.

On the dresser is a comb.

A mailbox is screwed to the wall by the door.

Lost in the Fog.

A strange phosphorescent smoke covered the area, catching several hues from an 
unknown light source. A charge was in the air, as if lightning were about to 
strike. The hairs on the back of my neck were erect. I had this terrible 
feeling that at any moment someone would wander up and ask me to dance.

You have been staring at this computer screen for hours.

Your eyes are losing focus and you blearily try to make out the digits on the 
spreadsheet.  You don't want to be at this desk, where people seem to regard 
you as the lowest form of life.  You'd much rather be at home in your garden 
eating the flowers.  'Eating'...?

You slump forward over your keyboard...

~~~

You are seemingly trapped in a walled enclosure, surrounded by grotesque... 
figures.  That venus fly-trap looks like the number two. Over there is a juicy 
tuber in the shape of an eight, while several boulders, round like noughts, 
stare evilly from their whitened faces.  

Something else is wrong: you are seeing all this from ground level and you

Treasure Chamber
This is one of the largest caverns you have ever been in.  The ceiling is forty 
feet up, and the walls are quite a ways away.  The ceiling is supported by 
massive pillars formed from stalactites and stalagmites.  The phosphorescent 
moss that lines the walls provides a dim glow.  Mysterious carvings have been 
left on one wall.  There is an opening to the east.

    In the center of the cave stands the object of your quest:  The massive,

for centuries.

On the massive pedestal is the Toaster of Battle Creek.

Lying in the darkness, feeling something wet and slimy on my back, I see a

And then it all fades away, the fog comes rolling over my memory like a morning

Finally, it all settles down just enough, and I try to take stock of my

This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your 
final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and 
the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, 
make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. 

However, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy 
car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head 
goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, 
unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's 
progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 
'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth

You're on a space station.  This is nothing special in itself, but for some 
reason, due to your body's genetics, your very presence is causing the station 
to become unstable.  Stay aboard, and the station will explode. 

You wake up this morning, intending to leave.  Unfortunately, the station's 
instability has already caused the station layout to change dramatically, and 
no one on the station even recognizes you...

In the avenue, in front of your house
You have the good fortune to live in a fine avenue with a lot of trees, which 
line the road to the north and end in a square: the maritime pines which adorn 
the avenue create a natural barrier between the road and the canal skirting it, 
guaranteeing a little shade. The sole flaw is a multitude of mosquitos, which 
have made the canal their home.

"Iam excito, non victus, quod oatefacio vestri animus et accipio meus redimio!"

You hear the words faintly above you, the commands infusing some part of you, 
and you wake, and begin clawing upwards.  The rotted wood of your coffin breaks 
easily, and you begin to scratch through the dirt, packed hard over the years, 
rising through the darkness.  A hand breaks through the surface, grabbing at 
the grass as you pull yourself through the dirt, obeying the call to wake and 
to serve...

Wait a minute.  Shouldn't that be patefacio?

Probably, as you don't feel bound at all.  As your head breaks through the 
ground, and you see a young lad, dressed in black with face paint around his 
eyes, smiling widely at your emergence, a thought runs through your rotted 
skull as you regard him.

Graveyard
The full moon shines down through a high valley in the surrounding mountains, 
illuminating the hardy, though bare trees and the slightly shaggy browning 
grass in this small cemetery.

Your grave is nearby, a bit messy from where you climbed out of it, your large 
gravestone illuminated clearly enough to examine by moonlight. There are other 
tombstones about as well.

The graveyard is ringed by a six-foot iron fence, a massive gated stone arch to 
the north the sole gap. The gates are open, and look to have been that way for 
a very long time.

You were looking for a birthday present for your niece Isabelle, that was it. 
The toy stores along Regent Street were blaring out pop music and the window 
displays were garish scenes of animated computer violence. But down a dim 
Victorian arcade you came across a different kind of toyshop, with a peeling 
rocking-horse behind a grimy window. Perhaps in here, you thought...

This back bedroom looks as if a bunch of horny teenagers just drank beer, 
smoked pot, and made out with their girlfriends in here, which is probably the 
case. The room is scattered with Women's undergarments, beer cans, small 
puddles of vomit, cigarette butts, empty ziplock baggies and (ugh!) used 
condoms. The smell of spilled bong water pervades the air, making you wrinkle 
your nose in disgust. Doorways lead south, west, and east.

The bag of pot you bought from your dealer lies on the green and gold shag

        PLOT INTRODUCTION

        A long time ago, when mystics, warriors and villagers 
        with smelly socks roamed the land, things were great. 
        You could slay dragons, beat up no-good thieves, and 
        even go on adventures with your drinking buddies. To 
        add to it all, there was a princess to chase after and 
        a king to swear allegiance to. All in all, life was 
        grand. 

        Until one day, that is...An evil dragon has taken refuge 
        in a nearby cave. As the King's chief dragon hunter, it is 
        up to you to slay the dragon dead. Good luck!

Hello!!!! You are William Tell in this: a game about William Tell. In this game 
you live in Swisserland, which is where the Switzes live. The Switzes love to 
ski and make cheese and clocks and bank accounts. You, William Tell, are a 
Swiss in my game about Swisserland. You live in Swisserland City, Swisserland, 
which is the capital of Swisserland. The year is 1307 AD and a really bad man 
is PRESIDENT of Swisserland. The PRESIDENT lives in a box on top of a flagpole 
in the center of Swisserland City which is the capital of Swisserland and 
everybody who sees the box has to salute the box and say, "HELLO! BOX!!!" and 
act very reverential because that is where the PRESIDENT lives. This is 
important because you, William Tell, do not like the PRESIDENT at all and you 
are going to refuse to salute the box because if you don't you won't get the 
OPTIMAL ENDING and you won't collect all 10,000 POINTS.

You, William Tell, live in the mountains of Swisserland in a BLUE hut. Today 
you come down from the mountains with WILLIAM TELL JUNIOR, your SON, who eats 
paint chips. 

It is a regular day in Swisserland City and you are with your SON. Little do 
the both of you know what fate has in store for you...!

      I've been a big fan of interactive fiction for a long time, playing my 
first real game in 1984 by the amazing Steve Meretzky. I'm a free lance 
programmer that officially went to school at the Chubb Institute for computer 
programming in 1998, but started programming computers all the way back in 1980 
on the old Apple IIs in my middle schools library. When I first ran across the 
Inform language it looked a little daunting, and without the DM4 documentation 
it seamed out of my reach. But now looking at it years later it seems very well 
put together, and easy to program. Kudos to Graham. 
      I also served the United States Marine Corps as an Avionics Technician 
working on F/A-18s. I found myself aboard CVN-70 the USS Carl Vinson, CV-63 the 
USS Kitty Hawk, and CV-61 the USS Ranger. It was my life aboard these aircraft 
carriers that inspired XSS Supalace.

      I currently host www.infodarkness.com, a personal website that has become 
a collection of gaming, music, and videos, which will also host Across The 
Stars.

You wake up slowly with a frightful headache to vaguely familiar
surroundings. There is a loud and curiously soothing swishing noise in
your ear. After a while you realise that you are on a train, and that
the noise you can hear is your watch as you prop up your head. You are
lying on an entire seat and feel lousy.
Slowly you sit up and look around you. As you do so, someone badtemperedly
occupies the half of the seat you just vacated. You can remember next to 
nothing
about yourself and how you came to be where you are. It is a disturbing 
feeling.
There are various people around, but most of them are showing a deliberate
lack of interest in you. I imagine you are an unattractive sight.
You are in a railway carriage at the end furthest from the destination
of the train. The main passageway continues through a black, rickety
connecting tunnel into another carriage.
You are facing the same way as the train.
There is a copper-coloured Yale key here.

In the dream, you are made of stars. You shine with a fierce, penetrating 
light, and you are pursuing a lightless void. Just as you are about to reach 
it, you wake up. As you slowly become more aware, you listen closely. Tap. Tap. 
Tap-tap. "Suddenly there came a tapping"?  It sounds like it's coming from the

You'd been soundly sleeping, comfortably, soundly sleeping, when Dr. Todd 
called. He's your thesis adviser, and as such, he holds unconscionable power 
over you, which he uses for, well, whatever he likes, really. "Hagerston," he'd 
said. (You do have a first name, but no, nobody ever uses it.) "You do think 
it's important we apply our brains in a logical way, and not yield to 
mumbo-jumbo and mystification?" You acknowledged this was true. With Dr. Todd, 
a bad idea. The result was you agreed to meet him in front of the Hotel 
Farfalla at 3 AM. There was some reason, perfectly logical according to Dr. 
Todd, for this request, but you can't for the life of you now remember what it 
was.

Front of the Hotel Farfalla
The Farfalla is one of the grand old San Francisco hotels. Not the sort of 
place you'd go on your own. But then you're not here because you wanted to be. 
It's eight stories of still pretty much gleaming white marble, and no doubt a 
room costs as much a night as your apartment does for the month. It was founded 
in 1898 by Luigi Fornoni and this is the second building to bear the name. The 
first was destroyed in 1906 and Signor Fornoni rebuilt in an even grander 
style. You'd got that far on the brass plaque when Dr. Todd showed up. It was 
more than you really wanted to know.

"Well, Hagerston, I'm glad to see you're here in order to accomplish our

What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That 
means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, 
and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl 
around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. 
Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who 
confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to 
stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their 
elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his 
legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

One day, after watching (or perhaps reading) too many Shakespeare
plays, you find yourself wandering around a wondrously enchanted land.
Here they use a richer language than is usual and you come across
scenes which may remind you of certain Shakespearean plays.

How you are going to return successfully to the present day is
something that you will have to find out for yourself but it
may be worthwhile to keep any valuables you come across.

An exhaustive knowledge of the Shakespearean canon is not necessary,
as in most cases just the problems rather than the solutions
are pinched from Shakespeare. Hints are probably available from
JRP1 if you get completely stuck.

For more basic advice, type HELP.

Piracy 2.0 - A Text Adventure in Space

by Sean Huxter 

Your shift began like most others as Captain of the United Worlds Guardian 
Class Patrol vessel, U.W.S. Ceres, a routine supply mission of no particular 
import, routine crew checks, signing this order, monitoring that communication, 
so it was not only a surprise, but an unexpected honor when your mentor, 
Admiral Copeland, contacted you by secure sub-etha channel to charge you with a 
highly sensitive mission. 

James Whitehall, perhaps this era's most renowned and reviled interstellar 
pirate, was cornered with his crew and captured yesterday out on the galactic 
rim, and he wasn't taken quietly. Though when the moment approached, 
Whitehall's crew bailed and fled in their tattered ship, abandoning their 
leader to the law. Under heavy guard, Whitehall was transported to the U.W.S. 
Orion, another Guardian Class ship, which was heavily damaged in the arrest 
operation. The Orion had to undergo immediate drydock repairs, but it was the 
only spaceworthy ship in the vicinity. 

Your mission was to rendezvous with the Orion and take charge of this deadly 
prisoner, allowing the Orion to get back to spacedock without further delay. 

The route you were instructed to take was a coded, randomly-generated series of 
course corrections which would have sent anyone trying to intercept you on a 
wild goose chase, as you were eventually to arrive and dock at Penal Satellite 
One, where Whitehall would be held until trial. 

You know the Admiral was putting some portion of his reputation on the line 
trusting you with this job, and you weren't about to let him down. 

But it didn't turn out that way. There must have been a leak somewhere, either 
on your ship or at United Worlds Command, because in an isolated sector of open 
space you were approached and attacked by a ramshackle pirate cruiser. 

The pirate crew had come for their leader. They made their intentions clear 
immediately, ordering you to heave to and be boarded. 

Of course you were not about to give up your prisoner without a fight, but 
their rag-tag ship, festooned with weapons, outgunned your ship's meager trio 
of laser cannons and its small crew. 

After an all-too-brief battle your ship was boarded, and as far as you know, 
your crew completely wiped out by the ruthless marauders. You wonder why you're 
still alive, guessing that your good fortune comes only due to the possibility 
you may yet be of some use to the pirates. 

Now, Whitehall, with a keycode for the Brig he must have tortured out of your 
Security Officer, escorts you personally to the cell and shoves you in. He 
laughs as the door locks behind you... 

(For information about Piracy 2.0, type HELP at any prompt. For a Walkthrough, 
type WALKTHROUGH.)

Brig
You're in a small, smooth-walled room with barely enough area to stand. A pair 
of simple bunk beds occupy most of the cramped space. There is a panel near the 
door. A faint smell of ozone is coming from the vent high above the beds. The 
pirates must have started some electrical fires. The only door is north, but 
it's closed and locked.

The Director's assistant follows you into the room. 

"As I told you, the Board of Trustees were impressed with your interview and 
they fully understand from your application why you see this as your perfect 
job. However, you failed to convince them on a single point: if you wish to 
become the new Director of the Museum and Institute for Puzzles and Problem 
Solving, they would like some evidence of your interest in solving problems. 
The retiring Director has been asked to assess you on that single point and, 
rather than interview you, he has set you an unusual test." 

With that, the assistant hands you a manilla envelope, then continues. 

"I am instructed to give you this envelope. Please read it and act on its 
contents. When you are ready to meet the Director, please ring the bell on his 
desk and I shall bring him in. He will ask you a single question. If you answer 
correctly, the job is yours: answer incorrectly and we shall have to look for a 
new candidate." 

The assistant moves briskly out of the room, wishing you a cheery "Good luck!" 
before shutting the door behind him. You hear the sound of a key being turned 
in the lock.

Office of the Director
This room reminds you of a Victorian study: it is roughly square and all the 
exposed walls are panelled with dark oak, up to a height of about six feet, 
with bare cream plaster above. In the centre of the room is an old mahogany 
desk, with a leather chair behind it. Beyond the desk is a stone fireplace, 
with a framed painting above it. One of the side walls is completely taken up 
with a book case, most of which is closed with glass doors. On the opposite 
wall, above a wooden table, is the only window, and sole source of light in 
this rather gloomy room. In the fourth wall is the single door. There is a 
clutter of miscellaneous items everywhere, and in the four corners of the room, 
you can see a hatstand, an antique globe, a wooden corner shelf and a low 
cupboard. 

At present you are standing beside the Director's desk, in the middle of the 
room.

On the mahogany desk are a blotter, a bell, a newspaper, a brown book and a 
magazine.

You rush to your master's side and await his instructions. He is studying a 
fragile looking scroll and muttering to himself.

He looks up and says, "Ah, there you are. This ..." -- he hands you the scroll 
-- " ... goes back in the vault. I believe it is still open. And this little 
beastie ..." -- he hands you a small, empty brass cage -- "... goes back to my 
private quarters. Thank you, that will be all."

You bow, and head downstairs to the vault. The heavy stone door is wide open, 
and a golden key juts out of the lock.

Without warning, someone shoves you roughly from behind. The scroll and the 
brass cage fly out of your hands as you fall to the ground. There is a loud

"HERE BE DRAGONS" is what the rutter said, but the small island turned out to 
be free of those animals after all. Instead, you landed near a tiny village 
full of friendly natives.

Aaah, shore leave! You can't remember when the last time was you could relax, 
take a night off and stroll through town to pick up a girl or two. It turned 
out your friend Aten speaks a dialect not unlike that of the villagers, and so 
he joined your captain, who's with the village elder at the moment.

"Too bad for him," you think, grinning, "guess he won't be getting any

You, on the other hand, are intent to.

Village Center
The center of this small village is a roughly circular clearing in the 
jungle-forest that covers most of this island. A gigantic tree stands in the 
middle, reaching hundreds of feet up into the cool night air. The huts of the 
villagers are strewn around the clearing's border, close to the jungle.
A large stone circle contains charred wood from last night's bonfire, and there 
is a rickety wooden platform under one of the lower branches of the tree.

You are here, at Sonny Rae Tempest's house, in Louisville, Kentucky, to 
interview him about his latest Atari VCS game poem "Calm, Mute, Moving." In 
your pocket is a note, on which you've scribbled some notes about potential 
question topics. Books, clothing, and shoes are scattered about the floor, so 
crossing the room seems a daunting effort requiring focus and proper 
foot-placement.

The front door, which is locked (must ask Sonny Rae about key), is on the north

You're relaxing at home, playing the violin when you hear knocking on what 
sounds like a wooden wall coming from the row of five houses opposite your own. 
You can't quite recall which of your neighbours has woodworking as a hobby. 
Fortunately you remember that each house has a unique colour and the owners 
have a unique name, have a unique nationality, play a different preferred IF 
game and have a different hobby. You also remember these facts pertaining to 
your neighbours:

  1.  The person who is Russian plays Child's Play.
  2.  The person who has a Brown House lives next to the person who likes 
gardening.
  3.  Archangel likes rock collecting.
  4.  Evren plays Three More Visitors.
  5.  The person who has a Navy House likes cooking.
  6.  The person who has a Yellow House plays Dash Slapney Patrol Leader.
  7.  Perdita lives in the fifth house.
  8.  The person who has a Brown House has a neighbour who plays Apoptosis.
  9.  The person living in the centre house plays Danse Nocturne.
10.  The person who is Latvian has a Blue House.
11.  River has a Fuchsia House.
12.  The person who is Russian is directly to the left of the person who is 
Greek.
13.  Ellis is Belarussian.
14.  Perdita lives next to the person who is Icelandic.
15.  The person who likes wine making lives next to the person who has a Blue 
House.

So, who is knocking on the wall?

It's Thursday night and you're at Mick's Unwashed Outback Tavern. All the girls 
you couldn't nail while wasting away at military school are out looking to meet 
interesting chaps like yourself and your compatriots. The 'Mick is kind of a 
meat-market (meaning that predators of both gender and varying sexual 
preference skulk about attempting to discern potential companionship for an 
evening... and the prey have no illusions about that). Your friends and 
co-workers Keegan and Pang have joined you. They're great guys to go 
bar-hopping with: Pang left to use the lavatory an eternity ago while Keegan 
just bolted to hit on a girl. They do, however, always have your back and allow 
you to be a complete assjack when you party together. You definitely lucked out 
in getting to know them as most of the people you meet at work are a bunch of 
stiffs. Tonight there really does seem to be an inordinate amount of sexy 
knock-outs to chat up. Pump it up, Avandre, and try not to bring your boys 
down!

Bar
You are up against the bar of Mick's Unwashed Outback Tavern and have a pretty 
solid view of the kids whom have come out tonight to party. Preps, goths, 
betties, freaks, cheerleaders, milfs, sorority types -- you've never seen the 
place so packed with such wholesome goodness. Fortunately it appears as if your 
competition contains an inordinate amount of chuds and losers.

Keegan returns, shaking his head. He briefly looks toward you. "God, she 
smelled like an absolute honeypot. And I don't mean that in a sexist way, I 
mean it literally. Like she had bathed in honeycomb or something." He takes a 
sip and continues. "I mean, I can deal with that, you  know? I told her I was 
having difficulty mating my plastic honey bear because the only other 
syrup-based lifeform I knew was Aunt Jemima and it didn't want to go hogging. I 
was about to ask her if she wanted to help out when she copped this major 
'tude. Apparently she was totally unaware what she smells like. Pfft. 
Clueless."

You nod. "Dude, no worries there. I'm guessing it would have ended badly when 
she got attacked by a swarm of yellowjackets right before you were about to 
drop the hammer."

Keegan grins at that, his morale restored. "Er, well, I also accidentally 
sneezed all over her. That probably had something to do with her rapid case of 
frostbite."

 "Another thrilling day at Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School," you 
think, with studied irony, as you get off the bus, trying to look as cool and 
bored as the other eighth graders. In truth, though, you really are a little 
excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special 
job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the 
building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on 
whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.

You are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the 
only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls 
in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being "The 
Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A." Today's temperature does 
nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.

As you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate 
from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster 
advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. 
The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick 
trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your 
school day starts.

The Enterprise Incidents
A Middle School Fantasy 
by Brendan Desilets
Release 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

The Cafe
The Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned 
room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, 
though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the 
north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of 
the day are stored.

Mr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his 
fifties and is wearing a "Save the Children" tie. 

"Hi!," he says. "It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the 
closet, Doug." He gives you a brass key. "Judy will be working with you, and so 
will the new girl who's joining us today.

"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy 
handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The 
new girl will serve mainly as an observer.

"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards 
and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in 
the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like."

"Any questions about your job today?"

Judy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and 
pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.

The new girl is known by the odd nickname "Queenie," or so you've been told.  
She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not 
especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. 

Judy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. 
Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, "Yes, 
Judy."

"Can I go the bathroom?" Judy inquires. 

Mr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, "I don't think 
that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll 
answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your 
own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to 
make your own hygienic choices."

"OK," she comments amiably.

Bedroom (on the bed)
When the springy energy of muscle long ago gave way to a slothful paunch, you 
didn't mind. You simply redirected your energies from the libertine idylls of 
youth to the ruthless game of business, and in that you succeeded admirably. 
You built Splinecorp from the humble beginnings of your parents' garage into 
the world's most prominent manufacturer of electronic goods. You invested your 
whole adult life into the company, and it paid you back handsomely, you 
sometimes consider as you relax in your sprawling, isolated mansion. But age 
takes its toll. Even your healthy middle-aged paunch began to dissolve, what 
remained of your muscles were consumed by sluggish board meetings, and 
innumerable diseases began to gnaw at you from the inside out. Your increasing 
frailty has confined you to this bed for the last five years, but your mind, of 
course, is as sharp as ever and you have no intent of relinquishing your place 
on the Splinecorp executive board. Fortunately, here in your linen prison, 
you've provided yourself with the tools to look after yourself: the rack of 
monitors hanging from ceiling keeps you informed, and of course your faithful 
Splinecorp-manufactured robots stand by, waiting your command. Hanging on the 
eastern wall is an ornate tapestry. And standing next to your bed is a 
comprehensive array of tubes, drips, and associated medical machines, and also 
a small nightstand. To the south is a doorway to the hallway.

The phone starts ringing.

You can see Levo and Pravo here.

Reality is so... unreal.

The tangle of observations woven about it, humankind's utter lack of consensus, 
phases it to fit individual desires. Becoming and unbecoming, back and forth 
eternally, as it paradoxically coexists with and within infinite variations of 
itself...

At least, that's what always surfaces in your mind whenever your own perception 
of reality is altered. Which is to say, ten or fifteen times a day. But it's 
your job, working to someday entertain others with new observations, new 
experiences, new realities. And after all, you signed up for the Project (as 
you well remember, even though it was close to five years ago), so you suppose 
it's entirely your fault if you don't like it. Which, when you think about it, 
you realise you do.

Justy's voice reaches out to you from somewhere you can't see. "Okay, this 
should be it. One final test run to check any overload potential, and this 
world is done! I'm starting her up."

A loud CLANK, and the Sphere begins spinning, with you inside it.

"Brace yourself!"

Bright lights.

Pain.

From somewhere off in your mind's distance, a telltale splash.

Then, as the resounding thrums fade, a distorted ripple sweeps your vision 
clear, and all traces of the laboratory vanish from your senses.

All five of them.

Wiped clean, twitching, anxious for new input.

Virtual reality has become reality.

Coral Reef
Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed, glittering 
in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves. 

You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability to move 
your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat, rudder-like 
tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond any known to man -- 
pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but your other senses appear 
strengthened.

The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and west, 
perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But    x  Wsswstndd jqgahergg

in your mind, soothes away all tension.

Only Justy's disembodied voice betrays the presence of a virtual reality. "I 
estimate at max one potential for overload, maybe two. This one isn't all that 
complex, compared to the lab sim. Cynthesiser's got the analysis sweep running 
in the background, so you may feel some slight distortion. It's nothing to 
worry about. Just give us a typical walk -- or should I say, swim? -- through 
it."

You are a typical adventuring type - brave, resourceful, and fearless.
After a career of non-trivially heroic actions, you decided to show
the forces of Chaos just who was boss, and so set out to pay them a
visit. As soon as you expressed this intent, however, you were magically
transported to another place - you feel sure that it is a convenient
prison world set up by the Lords of Chaos to store such as yourself.
It seems as though they no longer think to check on its inhabitants, so
perhaps you can escape and destroy your captors, using things brought
to the Nidus over the millennia.
For help, type HELP !

This game is very loosely based on a few web searches of the real Ottumwa, and 
watching too much TV. 

The place: Ottumwa, Iowa, population about 25,000 and the county seat of 
Wapello County since 1844. It is historically known as the gateway to southeast 
Iowa because of its access to the Des Moines River and to the railroad. 

You have come here for a well-deserved vacation, to relax away from the 
pressures of your job in the big city.  By trade, you are a skilled forensics 
analyst working for the police department, but today you are planning on 
getting in some good fishing. You need to get a fishing license from the local 
sporting goods store.

2007 David Hughes.

It's probably for the best (or worst?) that you gave money to a begging gypsy 
that one time, because now, you can travel between this realm a somewhat 
identical, parallel realm by saying "up" or "down." You're just that gifted, 
kid.  You've seen some strange things in the other world--your friends replaced 
with monsters, your things replaced with, uh, other things, and other strange 
ideas. You tried to tell this to your family, but they didn't believe you. Big 
mistake, my friend.

Now you're in a psych ward. You'd do anything to get out of this hellhole. Even 
the family that put you in wants you back - but the doctors keep diagnosing 
problems you know you don't have. The good news is that Maggie, the supervising 
nurse, won't notice you unless you go past her desk. The bad news is, well, 
you're not out yet.

But tonight is when you decided to make your getaway. Tomorrow's your big 
medical evaluation, and none other than Maggie, who's called you an 
"aggravating spider" just yesterday, is representing you. Why would you not 
escape?

Bedroom
Maggie has called lights-out for the evening. The window lets in a small amount 
of pink light from a gas station sign outside. You're in your green-walled

The teddy bear you brought from home is sitting in a dull, dusty trance on the

At the Show
You're in a dark, poorly lit and packed club. Everyone's staring at the band as 
they go about tuning and shifting their instruments. The guy next to you has a 
mohawk that flops over to the side, as if the heat had wilted it. In contrast, 
the skinhead in front of you is reacting to the heat like a Mexican jumping 
bean, the muscles of his back tensing and releasing, tensing and releasing.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
Before you can do anything, the band explodes into action. The crowd coalesces 
into a single entity and leans towards them, falls back, ripples spastically. 
Being part of this lurching creature makes your spine tingle.

You're pressed from all sides by people suddenly activated by sound -- but you 
can't hear anything. You can practically feel the sonic waves, see it on the 
faces of the people around you... You strain to hear the music... 

The guy with the mohawk plants his boot in the skinhead's linked hands. His 
pierced nostrils flaring, hands gripping the skinhead's shoulders, he launches 
himself on the crowd. Improbably, they hold him aloft as he rolls over a bed 
made of their shoulders, heads and outstretched hands. You can't quite believe 
what you're seeing, and suddenly you hear something:

"Honey?"

You whip around and look to see who spoke, but there's nothing except the 
unremarkable brick wall of the club lined with people standing on chairs to get 
a better view. None of them are looking at you.

You look back. The guy with the mohawk is still rolling over the crowd, but for 
some reason he's got a tie on. And his blue hair is flickering like flames. The 
skinhead offers his linked hands to boost you up, and you quickly put your foot 
in. But your foot is bare. He looks at you, his dark eyes questioning. You 
realize with dawning horror that it isn't just your foot that's bare -- you're  
in your underwear. You feel, rather than see, the eyes of the people in the 
crowd move towards you, brace yourself for the mocking laughter sure to 
ensue... 

"Honey! Get up!"

You're in your bed.

Your mother bustles in with your uniform, freshly ironed, and hangs it on your 
bathroom doorknob. "OK, honey, we're off," she says, stopping at the foot of 
your bed and putting her hands on her hips. "Better hurry or you'll miss your 
bus. Don't want to be late for the very first day of high school!"

You smile weakly as she kisses you goodbye and leaves, trying to rekindle the 
feelings in your dream.

Your Room (on the bed)
Your room is a mess -- posters slowly peel off the walls to join the small 
heaps of clothes that spot the floor like death mounds. There's a path south 
through the junk from your bed to your bathroom, one going north to the rest of 
the house.

You can see a school uniform here.

You have discovered that the outside world is dangerous. Pursued for
many days and nights by hordes of hostile beings, you have arrived,
breathless, at a sanctuary. It seems that you are trapped, as it would
be foolhardy to venture outside again. However, there may be more to this
place than you think...

You are at the western end of a primitive stone chapel. Light
streams in through the windows, which are set high above your
reach in the entirely featureless walls of the building.
A plain arch leads northwards to the world outside which,
as you know from experience, is extremely hostile.

Daffodils and snowdrops spring from the grass verges, adding a dash of colour

in the sunshine, beckoning locals and tourists alike to pop in for a drink. 
There is a small garden to the south of the road which is attached,

A short gravel track leads up to a wooden gate to your north-east.

Your car, a battered blue Volvo estate, is slewed across the grass verge, two

Your eyes attempt to focus. 

You're having one of those still moments that come toward the bottom of the 
whiskey bottle.  Everything is as bleak as it can get.  Lovely, for someone

alternate place.  Right now you'd rather be in any other place than

Expense Account Hotel Room

you've discovered trying to order adequate dinners from Room Service) till you 
get your goddamn book done.  Your deadline's three days away and you haven't 
written a solitary word.  Not word one;  zippo;  nada city.  Even if you could 
think of a word or (miracle of miracles) two you'd need to sober up massively 
before you could enter it into your laptop.

Oh, the room?  There's a bed that's been slept in way too often, unaltered by 
the housekeepers since your last nap.  There's a hotel chain's idea of a 
workdesk, a doorway into the bathroom at the southeast end of the room, a 
walk-in closet to the east, the door to the hallway in the northwest corner.  
Gillian your editor, bless her heart, instructed them to remove the t.v.  A 
minibar stands on the wall.

On the workdesk is a laptop connected to a printer (in which is an improbable 
supply of paper).

You also see a telephone.

The minibar supports a small coffeemaker.

Next to the coffeemaker are three packets of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.

never again be able to use his Psychotronic Strank-Inversor to enslave the cute 
yet intelligent Swoobies. The death of the Swoobie princess still brings a tear 
to your eye.

Gleaming lights cover the walls. Several big screens are active. Some show the 
surface of strange, unknown worlds. Some display nothing more than stars. A big 
chair in the middle of the room looks like a throne and anyone sitting here 
must look very powerful indeed. It is clear that this is the heart of the evil 
empire. This is the centre of war and destruction. This is the office of 
Emperor Jacklejitt III.

Some explosives have been placed in the room.
A large torture table stands next to the throne.

The tour had been going exceedingly well up to this point. You've always 
yearned to visit a Ghost Town and your affection for the Old West has never 
been stronger. It stemmed from your early years of playing Cowboys and Indians 
with the neighborhood gang. When the opportunity came up, this was a no-miss 
trip! A remote town on the old Texas-Mexico border that has been left untouched 
and well-preserved in the arid climate for more than a century. This is exactly 
the vacation that you have craved! At one time, this place was a bustling 
little frontier town of notable repute. Nameless now, the town was once filled 
with frontiersmen. "Gauchos" the underpaid South American tour guide kept 
calling them. Cowboys by any other name. It doesn't matter what nationality a 
cowboy is, he remains an icon and a legend. You couldn't wait to get here - 
when you logged out of the Geek and set your Facebook status to 'On Vacation', 
you were going totally tech-free, just like the pioneers did. Even more special 
is that this particular no-name town was founded by none other than General 
Jebbidiah Alden in 1865. A Civil War hero who made it his mission in life to 
help rebuild after the destruction caused by the war. General Alden was 
well-liked and well-respected. History remembers him kindly. His descendants 
still live only a few hundred miles from the site of this now long-abandoned 
ghost town. Unfortunately, your allergies have kicked in at the worst possible 
time. Before long the tour guide was speaking but all you could concentrate on 
was the stuffiness in your head. Breathing became a labor and staying alert a 
chore. If you could just rest your head for a few minutes... It wasn't exactly 
clear when you fell asleep, but the tour guide and your fellow tourists have 
moved on without you. The last thing you can remember is the tour guide saying 
that the group could take a short break for lunch, take a last look around and 
then get back on the bus for the trip home. As you wake up, you can hear the 
clunker of a bus pull out of the parking lot to the north. 

Welcome to Gaucho! Your goal is to survive one (1) night here in this ghost 
town so you can be picked up by the next tour bus that will arrive in the 
morning. With your allergies acting up, you'll need a good night's sleep to 
make it through. And you are so thirsty that you'll never be able to sleep 
without a good long chug of water. To survive in this old frontier town, you 
will need all of your wits to combat puzzles and obstacles that stand in your 
way. As you progress, you will uncover various special items and, quite 
possibly, some gold. At the end of your adventure (if you either Win or Quit), 
you will be given a unique code that you can use on the Geek to claim special 
microbadges and geekgold. At any time during the game, you can type SCORE to 
see your progress. If you wish to give up and simply claim your earned prizes, 
you can type QUIT. If you win the game, it will be obvious as to how to claim 
your prizes. The maximum score for this game is 100. If you need a bit of 
generic help, type HELP. Good luck!

Secluded Alley
You are standing in a secluded alley. The sun is mostly shielded by the

a nice soft pile of dirt to nap on. But now that the wind is picking up,

It's been almost a month since your parents disappeared. 

One Tuesday, they just didn't come home, and there's been no sign of them 
since. For the University and the rest of the town, the mystery is beginning to 
pall. To those people, it's as if Claire and Scott Colborn suddenly stopped 
existing -- strange and inexplicable, to be sure, but forgettable in the long 
run. 

But for you it's as if the ground beneath your feet stopped existing, and 
you've been plummeting in freefall ever since. Your brother Austin, though, has 
been a rock through the whole experience, handling the numbing details, the 
endless meetings with useless detectives, even sorting through Mom and Dad's 
lab in hopes of finding an answer. Now you stand outside the lab door, 
clutching his note, hardly daring to hope that such an answer may have arrived 
at long last.

                       Welcome to WEARING THE CLAW...

                      [Please press SPACE to continue]
[ 'Twas Crisis -- All the length had passed
  That dull -- benumbing time
  There is in Fever or Event --
  And now the Chance had come --
   
  The instant holding in its claw
  The privilege to live
  Or warrant to report the Soul
  The other side the Grave.
   
  -- Emily Dickinson]

If it's not an adage, it ought to be: a lord asks no favor from a peasant. Yet 
there he was, in your own family's modest home, waving what used to be his hand 
in the air and looking at you with eyes full of supplication.

"You have proven yourself to be the ablest, cleverest, and wisest youth in the 
province, and it is to you we must turn to save us from this affliction, " 
insisted Lord Midel. He gestured with his transformed hand, which had become 
the paw of a lion, at the similarly changed appendages of your family members. 
Following the arc of his paw, you ended up looking down at your father's feet, 
changed into oxen hooves by the cruelty the wizard Marnian had inflicted on 
your poor province and everyone in it.

Your mother's dove wing fluttered anxiously as she looked at you through pained 
eyes, and said, "I fear for you, dear one, but perhaps you can find on your 
quest some means of restoring prosperity to our village, which has been too 
long poor." You gazed for the hundredth time at the too-worn, too-old cottage, 
at your transformed brother and sister, and at your own left hand, now the paw 
of a wolf, and finally turned to your lord, saying "There seems no other path. 
I accept your proposal."

Lord Midel clapped you on the shoulder and said, "It's settled then -- I 
believe you are the one who can save our people from this wearing of the claw. 
Find the Pendant of Elinor, as the wizard has demanded, and bring it back to 
me. It is the only thing that can save our province. Now come, for I am not 
without magic of my own."

You gathered your things, said a solemn farewell to your family, and followed 
Midel into the center of town, where he sprinkled a sparkling powder over you, 
and recited an incantation... and you suddenly found yourself alone on a dirt 
path, the cold wind assailing your face.

"I'm sorry, Mother. I know this isn't the career you wanted for me. But it's 
something I believe in. I consider it a great opportunity and one I can't pass 
up."

A silver-haired woman in her later years stands before you with her hands 
shaking and her eyes in tears. "I know, Jake. I know. You've always made good 
decisions, and I'm proud of you no matter what. It's just... so very dangerous. 
I'm worried. Why did you have to sign on with... with..."

You reach out in a feeble attempt to comfort your mother, but the vision fades 
as it always does in this dream. Never a second opportunity, never another 
chance to make things right before...

"Breeeeet... Breeeeet... Level 5 Emergency... Level 5 Emergency. Cryogenic pods 
activated. Hull Temperature now at critical. Guidance System damaged. Main 
Deflectors destroyed. Descent proceeding on last known trajectory..."

Your hearing is always the first to respond after waking from cryogenic 
hibernation. A few seconds later the other senses begin to thaw and your eyes 
regain some level of focus. Normally the first thing you would see is the soft 
glow of the overhead cabin lights. This time, however, your senses are greeted 
by unfamiliar and harsh stimuli. The tremendous light and heat, bearing down 
with the intensity of a hundred suns, don't allow your eyes to open for more 
than an instant. The grating noise all around you builds to a fevered pitch as 
it drowns out the automated warnings.

A few seconds later comes a thunderous boom, followed by darkness, and finally 
silence.

When you regain consciousness you are in possession of the single worst 
headache you can remember. Granted, this is the only headache you can remember 
having. Other than the bump on your head, you can vaguely remember a dream of 
your mother... and very little else...

Do you want to be told the details of your mission?
y
 You have been summoned to MI7 headquarters, popularly known as
'The Zoo' in order to unmask a mole. The chief of MI7, Sir
Arthur Cayley (known to his friends as 'Z') is extremely
worried, because the plans for the new Sonic Macrothrodule are
believed to have been leaked. They were kept in the safe in his
office, and were there yesterday when he came in at 9 a.m.; the
safe had been disturbed when he checked it this morning but the
plans were still there. Z reckons that it would take at least an
hour to remove the plans, copy them, and return them.

 With Cayley is Superintendent Hardy of Special Branch, who has
been assigned to MI7 on special duties for some weeks.

 "We're off for a drink in the 'Cloak and Dagger' now," says Z.
"Take a look round. Because of your unofficial position we can't
openly give you access to the files, but if I were you I'd start
with my secretary's office while she's downstairs -- she'll have
details of my movements yesterday, as well. You can probably
rule out Newton, who is abroad, and Brauer, who's on holiday.

 Nobody else knows you're in the building now that a new
Security guard has come on duty. The guard usually patrols at
about 7 p.m. Don't let anyone see you, or you'll have to abandon
the investigation. Come and find us if you think you have some
useful information. Good luck!"

 Cayley and Hardy are joined by a third person as they go down the stairs.

 Are you ready to start?
y
You are at the Southern end of the first-floor corridor, which
seems to be fairly brightly lit throughout: for security
purposes the lights seem to be fixed to be on at all times.
Three doors confront you at this point, each bearing the name of
their alleged occupants. To the south, the notice says "Sir
Arthur Cayley K.B.E. M.A. Head of Department." To the west, a
similar sign says "Miss Pell. Secretary." and to the east the
notice says "Russell. Accounts" There is further corridor to the
north, with several more closed doors leading off it.

"Hello, kiddies, welcome to the first ADDition of TALES FROM THE COLLEGE. I'm 
your host Mr. Worse, Dean of PERMANENT student residence. Since this is my 
FIRST-YEAR show, I wanted to show you a DOUBLE ROOM but I had trouble selecting 
a roommate. I couldn't DIFFERENTIATE between them. So, tonight I've decided to 
introduce you to Kevin Johnson. But unfortunately he's been experiencing a 
BINARY BREAKDOWN. Perhaps, you can ADVISE him or maybe all he needs is...A 
BREATH OF FRESH BLAIR!"

*SNAP* That was the sound of your last nerve cracking. You've lived here in 
Blair Hall too long. The neglectful RA, the screams at night, the fights in the 
halls and the vomit in the bathroom. You've tolerated it all until now. But now 
the sight of the broken dryer has caused the very last ounce of tolerance you 
had to come smashing down. You mind has performed a complete register dump of 
it's ability to think rationally. You are experiencing a BINARY BREAKDOWN!

Your Office (on the office chair)
Your office is a small austere room with a bare floor and a desk at the south 
wall, covered with piles of various work papers. The office lamp provides soft 
white light. At one side of the desk, your computer is humming softly, the 
familiar sound of the ventilation filling the office. Currently, you are

instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual 
shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on

Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had 
the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get

The prophecies have come true, one by one.  The earthquakes, the eruptions, the

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To 
the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with 
an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise 
several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In 
the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west 
wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of 
sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in 
the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis 
court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively 
large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled 
among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green. 
 Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like 
a relic from the 1930s.

Dead Storage
This is a storage room. It contains an incredible assemblage of discarded junk. 
Some of it is so old and mouldering that you can't be sure where one bit of 
junk stops and the next begins. It's piled to the ceiling on ancient, rotting 
pallets. A narrow path winds eastward through the junk.

>SEARCH JUNK
You find many worthless items of hardware, old discarded memos and papers, but 
nothing of any use or value. But wait...
What's that in the corner? A lesser adventurer may have passed this by but not 
you. It seems to be an old Commodore PET computer and looks like it just might 
work. Next to the computer are two tapes one with the word "Zombies" scrawled 
on it in Biro. The other one is labeled "Wrap". Behind the computer on the wall 
is a power outlet.

>EXAMINE COMPUTER
In computer years this computer is older than Noah's Ark, but in actual years 
it is a little over two decades old. It consists of a monochrome monitor, tape 
deck, keyboard (with lots of funny little symbols on the letter keys including 
hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs, and corners, sides and crosses to allow the 
user to draw boxes on the screen), on/off switch and power cable; all build 
into one convenient trapezoidal unit. Performance wise it uses an 8 Bit MOS 
6502 processor, has a whopping 4K of memory and the BASIC language on a built

This is a very simple text racing game. You control the car with the arrow keys 
(accelerate, brake, left and right) and drive around a simple track. When 
you're tired just press space.
Note that this game uses realtime key reading, so check that your interpreter 
supports it. Also note that you'll have to adjust the window size.
Everything is set... your car ready...so... GO!!

  It's a bright and cold december morning and all the world is snow-white; it 
looks like a landscape right out of a fairy-tale. You're standing here at the 
side of a lake. Boys and girls from the town are ice-skating on its frozen, 
mirror-like surface. However, nobody seems to notice you. Although wish to 
cheer with them; it looks like noone seems to be interested in a young 18 year 
old runaway orphan. So you just stand here and watch them playing, and their 
happiness cuts deep into your heart.
  In the distance, you hear bells chiming solemnly. A married couple walks past 
you, dragging a Christmas tree behind them on a toboggan. A little girl follows 
them, holding a can with Christmas cookies in her hand. Breathing in the 
fragrance of the cookies, her eyes glitter with delight. This all reminds you 
of the sad fact that it's Christmas Eve.

It's late in the day, classes were hellish, and the last thing you need is to 
come home and hear this on your answering machine:

"Hey man, it's Keith. The pigs finally got me, and if they ever manage to find 
my address book, they'll probably be coming for you too. I can't tell you where 
I've hidden it, for obvious reasons, but if I were you I'd try to find it 
first, along with any other questionable items you may have "lost." By the way, 
I wouldn't hang around your room too much - that's the first place they look 
for you... Damn! Time's up, I gotta go... good luck!"

You are in your dorm room, in Linnell House. It is bigger than a breadbox, but 
not by much. The door is to the north.

There is a standard-issue dorm table here, on which are a wallet (which is

It seems that Sherman is really on the verge of indeed carrying out his threats 
this time.
"Believe me: You are really going to be in major trouble if you're not paying 
within two weeks' time!" he exclaims, no longer trying to conceal his anger.
"Oh, calm down Mr. Sherman", you try to appease. "You see, I've encountered 
some minor difficulties in business this month and..."
"That's what you always say! I will call you in a few days! Better do something 
to have the money then!" Sherman shouts into the phone and hangs up.
Bankers... What do they know?

It's just one of these days... Actually, it's Wednesday, July 8th and you spent 
the whole of this beautiful summer morning sitting in your office, smoking and 
thinking about how to pay these outstanding debts Sherman, the bank manager, 
keeps talking about. There wasn't a brain wave among the ideas you had.
To be precise, you didn't even have any idea so far. 

Your Office
(You are on the leather chair.)
Your office is furnished in an extremely simplistic style: An old desk, an old 
telephone and fax machine sitting on it, some file cabinets (the cheap ones, 
made of metal), two chairs (one made of leather behind the desk -- where you 
are sitting right now, and a wooden chair in front of the desk -- for your 
customers). That's it. There's a window looking out on a grey backyard in the 
south wall. The door, out of here, is to the north and is currently closed.

must be removed! Not only has he shown
himself completely incompetent as a
necromancer, but he has also used the
only spell he's managed to comprehend
for an infantile lark!" A tall, somewhat
paranoid-looking wizard clears his
throat. It is Eskil the scrollmaker. He
says: "I think we should send him to
Kvill's castle. He can't do any harm
there." Bulbous replies: "Very well!
We'll send him to Kvill's castle!" He

Another fine day in the Internet Service provider business. You hang up the 
phone as you complete the order for that brand new MUD you're going to install 
on the server. It's Saturday night right before Easter and in the heart of the 
Spring Break. Your customers are going to love the new game. You'll have it up 
and running in just a few minutes in the nick of time for all those people with 
alot of spare time. You turn to your computer to begin downloading the new game 
file so you can wrap up and go home. Thunder rumbles. A storm is coming.

As you begin to glide your mouse to the top of your browser to enter a URL
there is a flash outside and the lights flicker! Instantly you hear lots of
loud buzzing noises as the many reserve power supplies in your office come to 
life to keep your internet server online. The buzzing stops, the lights stay
on. Satisfied, you enter the URL of the web page you want to visit and hit 
[Enter]. Your browser tells you it is unable to find the server. Impossible! In 
a split second a wave of fear crosses your mind as you realize the one way this 
could happen...

In panic you run into the computer room and it looks like Christmas; Your Cisco 
router, that magical box that puts your server onto the internet, is 
hysterically blinking. Your worst nightmare becomes real: You are an Internet 
Service Provider without the Internet.

Computer Room
You are in the Computer Room where the main Excaliber server is kept. A large, 
long wooden table is cluttered with a full-size computer tower, Pioneer CD ROM 
changers, a 17 inch computer monitor and various other equipment. A doorway to 
the east leads to the main set of offices.

A Cisco 1000 Router is here, its various lights blinking hysterically.

Initialising the Quill runtime...

...as in a dream, you can see yourself
being slapped on the back by a person
with german accent, thence tumbling down
a short escalator, and then, the image
of the aforementioned man producing
various items from a steaming briefcase,
a 30 ft. deep well, and seven useless
objects carried by an old and wise-
looking, yet oddly inane man. The images
are blurred, as if viewed through a veil
of some sort (probably silk). These
images give way for another set of
images: of you doing your homework,
jogging in the forest, washing the car,
pruning the fruit trees, involved in
activities including the opposite sex...
in short everything you could have been
doing if you weren't playing this game.
The images fade away...
A wizard appears, carrying a broken
zipper out of which fall various items,
among them a pair of jeans, a poodle and

a pair of speakers. These items immedi-
ately disappear through the magic of
stage-craft. He is almost ready to burst
into tears as he asks you: "Where can I
go to get my zipper repaired?"
Rance the dungeonkeeper appears. He
takes the wizard by the arm and leads
him off, saying: "Questions, questions,
questions, flooding into ze mind of ze
conzerned young person zoday..."

INTRODUCTION
    You are Odieus, son of Odielle of the ancient Winwood family. Coming from a 
long line of sorcerors and enchantresses, you naturally undertook the 
presevation of your ancestric traditions. In Oxvord you majored in casting 
spells and you received you Phd in Effective Cursing and Spell Flinging.
    Just two zifs ago, your bitter archenemy Blackwing son of Blackfeather has 
deviously contrived to seperate you from the most important instrument of your 
field - your magic flingshot. Being an expert Filcher, he has successfully 
executed his evil designs. But you don't panic, you keep calm. Only after 
scrambling through the village yelling at the top of your lungs and frantically 
searching through every nook and cranny for a clue, do you finally decide to 
consult your friend and fellow Flinger, Zinness son of Zinnesess.
    Having reclined liesurely on his plush velvet sofa and chatted comfortably 
for about half a zif, he advises you to pursue Blackwing and obtain eternal 
vengeance. You bravely undertake the mission and declare your absolute 
confidence, but oddly you can't stand up since your knees are shaking too much. 
When you recover, Zinness takes you into his flingroom and transports you 
somewhere near Blackwing's abode; that is, the Pit.

Area Flung
This cool grassy area is where Zinness flung you. Apparently you are somewhere 
near Blackwing's Pit. To the south a glass structure glints in the sun, and a 
dismal cottage lies to the east.

Note:  This file was compiled from Graham Nelson's Release 5. Some interpreters 
may complain about there being no graphics file. This is because there isn't 
one (yet). Hopefully the interpreters will play the file anyway. This file is 
provided as an example of the use of the Version 6 format for text only games.
Please report any Version 6 related problems to me.

This game was compiled with V6Lib version 0.827 (private beta)

If things scroll off of the screen that shouldn't (like the windows on the top 
of the screen, then your interpreter probably doesn't support V6 correctly.

CHAPTER ONE: HAPPY FAMILY

Wet, tired and incredibly bored.

That just about sums up your present frame of mind. Standing in an almost empty 
churchyard in a ghostly nondescript town, all the while being soaked by 
constant rainfall, would be bad enough at the best of times.

What makes it even worse is the very fact you're here. An all too often 
forgotten niece at her uncle's funeral. You're starting to wish you hadn't made 
the long journey up north after all. It's not like Uncle Henry actually cared 
about anything except his money and his ego, and you just wish the priest would 
get on with this tiresome ceremony.

After it's finished you could go home, emptying any lingering thoughts of the 
selfish, arrogant man from your mind.

Graveyard
Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many gravestones and 
the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend in perfectly with the 
sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the south, with the promise of 
relatively safe territory beyond, can't begin to neutralise their gloomy 
surroundings.

Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

A group of mourners are gathered around the latest addition to the cemetery. 
The parish priest stands nearby, reading the last rites at a painfully slow 
pace.

>That was a rhetorical question.

The priest pauses for a moment before continuing with his speech.

"There are those of us who are misguided in life, those who seek to inflict 
pain on others in order to further their own desires. Henry Lambert was one 
such person."

Somewhere nearby is Humongous Cave, where others have found fortunes in 
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen 
again. The object of the game is for you to explore the cave and return 
(safely) with as much treasure as possible. The cave is a mysterious and 
magical place. You will face many puzzling and perilous challenges as you 
explore.

End of Road
You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building through a pair 
of one-foot pipes and down a gully to the south. Next to the door of the 
building, there is a faded sign.

There is an order form here.

An open field

 As night approaches, and thick storms rise out from troubled skies.
   Like a spectre you appear.
   Called by a clap of thunder.

A messenger of death, the ghastly owl flutters, and with dreary shrieks he 
passes you by.

From somewhere far away a church bell sounds some early hour. Its sound crawls 
slowly through cold, mist laden air. 
A dead chime.

The bell has called you.
Out of space, out of time...

It is night. You find yourself standing in a grass field, surrounded by dark, 
shadowy trees. To the NORTH, the back stones of some ruined gothic structure 
rises high into the nights sky, silhouetted against a blood red moon.

It's black empty, windows, like eyes watch you far below.

Toaster Hill
So there's this forest that's out of the way but not too far out of the way and 
some folks decided to dump their old household appliances. It's tradition, now. 
Toaster Hill is entirely literal; it overlooks a winding road to the south with 
what has to be 20 or 30 old toasters.  The flashlight's reflection gives the 
toasters a dull, gentle glare. Once you had an argument with Tommy if it was 
possible for something to be beautiful and ugly at the same time, and he said 
no, and you said Toaster Hill, and he said ok sure you're right which is weird 
because your arguments usually lasted longer than that.

Today is October 31st, 1987. Your friends have invited you to join them for a 
night of camping and partying. The campsite is around a two hour drive from 
where you live now. You aren't sure who the property belongs to, but it's not 
far from where Fred Murks' grandmother lived. You, Fred, and another friend of 
yours named Steve Dirks had made the site as kids before she died a couple of 
years later from pneumonia. You haven't been back since then. It was at least a 
cool place to go when you were too young to be smoking cigarettes because no 
one ever bothered you out there.

Your friends are bringing the camping equipment, food, and beer. It should be a 
fun night. Supposedly some girls were going to be showing up as well, but we'll 
see about that.

You come around one last tight curve and see Fred's car parked on the side of 
the road. It's probably safe to assume that they have already gathered their 
stuff and went to set up camp. You park nearby, and then feel the chilly air of 
the Fall afternoon as you step out of your car and lock the door...

You are standing by the road that brought you here. A large mountain looms on 
the other side of it. You can barely make out the faint white noise of rushing 
water coming far from the southeast. To the west of you is a clearing in the 
briers which provides an entrance to the woods.

The sand stretches around you in all directions.

There is a grassy countryside. Rocks are scattered about.

You are in a room. The room has walls and a ceiling.

You blink. It seems as though you've been standing here forever. You feel 
suddenly stressed; There is something you have to do.

Kitchen
The stench of offal hangs in the air.The walls drip with fresh blood. An ugly 
table supports plates and a massive assortment of cutlery. This is not an 
environment that encourages rational thought. Empty doorframes lead north, 
east, south and west.

PROLOGUE: BREAKTHROUGH

"Due to the circumstances and lack of developments in your project so far, your 
contract will be terminated, effective immediately."

That's what he said. Some stupid corporate moron sitting in his office, wearing 
a daft suit and DigiCorp Technologies tie. Years of work, dozens of failed 
experiments, all the effort, simply to be phased out by a bunch of stupid 
company directors. As you stand alone in your laboratory, thinking about what 
might have been, you feel desolate. If only the blasted machinery would work!

Laboratory
The lab is a complete shambles. Hurriedly stacked pieces of paper make your 
workbench in the centre of the room totally unrecognisable. Steps lead up to 
the rooftop, the lab storeroom is to the north, and the exit from the 
laboratory is to the south. In one corner of the lab is the result of what is 
in effect your entire life's work, the translocation machine.

>That was a rhetorical question.

From outside the building comes the muffled sound of thunder.

"This is it!" he says as he dodges the last pothole and brings the truck to a 
stop. After twenty miles of the worst washboard road the country has to offer, 
you're just happy to have arrived.

You place your sandaled feet on solid ground and take a deep breath. The smells 
of autumn are at once sweet and earthy and full of the aroma of moisture and 
living things. A cool breeze blows in your face, soft and gentle. What a nice 
change, what a welcome relief from the tension and hustle of all you've left 
behind this weekend. It's just you and your husband, as he promised over a 
month ago.

You look around. What passes for the road you just traveled ends abruptly here. 
Over the last hour, bad asphalt gave way to gravel, which gave way, in turn, to 
the rutted two-track you see beside you. Ahead, the ruts continue, but it'll be 
on foot if you're to go any further. The old beater truck stands here, engine 
off but still ticking from the trip. Your husband closes the driver's door and 
comes around the rear to join you.

"How's my pretty lady?" he asks as he wraps his arms around you and places a 
kiss on your cheek from behind. "Tired, huh? Come on. Let's get the stuff. 
We'll be able to relax better once the tent's up."

He takes the two packs from the back of the truck and helps you into yours, 
then leads the way through the brush to the north. You roll up on the balls of 
your feet and give your pack a nudge, then pull the waist strap tight. Without 
looking back, you follow.

That was last night, and you hiked a short trail to a campsite off in the 
woods. Together you set up the tent, fixed a quick dinner, and fell asleep in 
each other's arms...

You wake with a start, something's missing, and you notice the sleeping bag is 
empty beside you. On his pillow is a handwritten note, which you collect. He 
must have crawled out early, as the sky is only now beginning to lighten.

You dress quickly, slip out of the tent, and follow the trail to the east.

Aspen Grove
You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all directions. 
Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin fingers, stroking the 
clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of gold rattle as the winds 
shift, and here and there one floats to the ground to join others that crackle 
underfoot when you move. A narrow path disappears east into the trees, and a 
camping area is visible through a small opening to the west. North is a wide 
meadow.

Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

> You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

Thank you for playing The King and the Crown, the first ever completed 
interactive fiction by Wes Lesley. This work of fiction was created to be 
submitted to IF comp 2015, and was written in one afternoon on Sunday July 
fifth, 2015. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had dreaming it up. 
Also, I have tried my best to make sure there are no annoyances when using 
text-to-speech while playing this game, however, I cannot be certain that 
everything will be translated smoothly into audio.

                                  For Lissy
                           Ever loving. Ever loved.

                           'The King and the Crown'
                The story of a King and the Crown on his head.

 It will be a big day for you today. No, wait. It will be a long day for you 
today. Starting with getting your Crown out of the cabinet behind the throne 
and your Scepter from ... wherever it is you left it last night. You really 
should keep a better eye on it.

The commonfolk are already piling up to meet their beloved King. Well, I say 
'beloved' - I should say 'at least less despised than the ones across the 
border'. All in all you're doing an okay job. Too bad that your father just had 
to outdo his own father - who killed one dragon - by killing the rest of them. 
Now instead of questing for glory you're stuck arbitrating disputes about the

off all day... Some of them brought their dogs. Why did they bring their dogs?

Good luck, my King. I fear you may need it.

Throne Room
A big throne room north of the main hall, both right out of medieval fantasy, 
adorned by big red banners with the family crest on them and stained glass 
windows to the east, north and west. And a throne, of course. That's where you 
sit and it also blocks the view of the intricately detailed but slightly 
unsightly Royal Cabinet which stores the Royal Crown for Royal Safekeeping.

Isn't it always like that? You spent a hot morning chivvying the plow and the 
Bishop up and down the north field. No satisfaction there -- it's just to turn 
in the clover. The view and the Bishop's hind end never change -- a mule's ass 
no matter what you call the mule, and Reverd Pearson has lectured you enough 
about calling him "the Bishop," but you figure he's your mule so you can call 
him what you like -- the mule, that is, not Reverd Pearson -- anyway, a whole 
morning and now it's time to chop the wood, and your good axe has gone missing.

Reverd Pearson would say you're a careless lunkhead who'd lose his ear if it 
wasn't nailed on. You figure he's right, a man of the cloth, but that doesn't 
mean piskeys didn't steal the thing. You know about piskeys.

Your Front Room
Reverd Pearson says a man's home is his fortress. Your home is two rooms of 
dressed timber, but the roof doesn't leak, so that's fine. Not enough of a 
fortress to keep out the piskeys, though, it seems. The front door is west, and 
east is where you sleep in back.

A maplewood table stands in the center of this room. It's your home's pride 
(though the Reverd has warned you about pride) -- a handsome furnishing that 
your cousin down the road made for you when your house was raised. Every time 
you walk in you're pleased to see it. Only there should be an axe leaning 
against the table's corner, and there isn't.

A battered book is lying on the table, though.

"Los Angeles, California. City of Angels." 

"Not so fast, Sherlock; I'm no angel." She pauses, the cigarette poised an inch 
from her lips. A stray beam of sunlight leaks from a broken slat in the 
venetian blinds, spotlighting her hair. Blonde. Platinum, not gold. Abruptly, 
she reaches across your desk to push a stack of green at you, past the halfway 
point. Her eyes watch yours as she fans the money out on the desktop. "I never 
mix business with pleasure. Do you?" 

Not often. Not lately. "Not me," you assure her. "Wouldn't dream of it." 

She leans back in the chair, studies the smoke curling from the cigarette 
between her fingers. "I--we don't visit L.A. much anymore. My husband, he hates 
it; won't go near the place. Calls it the City of Angles. Says everybody's got 
one, you know? An angle, I mean." 

"Your husband sounds like a man with his head screwed on tight." 

She laughs, a short, bitter sound with no amusement behind it. "That night, I 
did go to L.A. Without Walter. When I got home, late, the cops were waiting for 
me." She kills the cigarette with a quick stab at the ashtray. "If Walter dies, 
I'll inherit millions. My alibi--well, let's just say it doesn't help. Get the 
picture?" 

Her old man was right, everybody's got an angle, even dames with more curves 
than a mountain road. A guy could hurt himself on all that geometry.

Inside Room 401 (on your wooden swivel chair)
Welcome to your executive office suite. Private. Furnished. Centrally located. 
Paid for this month--if all goes well--by the beautiful and wealthy Jessica 
Kincaid. Never mind the filthy window with a crack across one corner. Or the

Jessica Kincaid is parked in the wing chair.

You can also see your desk (on which are a telephone, an ashtray and five 
twenty-dollar bills). In the ashtray is a Chesterfield cigarette butt.

>"Whatever."

From her handbag, Jessica extracts a newspaper clipping and unfolds it. "I 
don't know whether you've been following this case," she continues, "but here's 
a sample of what I'm up against." She reads:

"'Police have intensified their investigation into the brutal hit-and-run of 
real estate tycoon Walter Kincaid, who remains hospitalized since late Friday 
night. Although no witnesses to the incident have come forward, several people 
reported seeing a late-model white Jaguar convertible speeding through the area 
minutes before Kincaid was discovered. By all accounts, the driver, a blonde 
woman in her mid-twenties, was driving in a reckless and erratic manner. 
Authorities have not yet located the automobile; however, a similar vehicle is 
believed to belong to the victim's wife, who was not at home when the incident 
occurred.'" 

She glances up. "In case you haven't guessed, my car is a brand new '48 white 
Jag convertible. Or, rather, it was. It's missing." She wads the article into a 
ball and stuffs it back into her purse. "I'm in trouble, shamus. Deep trouble. 
I need you to get me out of it."

Working for Apex Lair Security Services, you've met all kinds of interesting 
people. As a matter of fact, Ornomir the Deathlord doesn't sound much different 
from several other clients whose treasure-laden underground lairs you've 
guarded in the past. He's richer than most of them, however, and very 
influential; Ornomir carries a lot of weight in the wealthy subterranean-comp
lex-owning community. Do this job well, and if Ornomir puts in a good word for 
you it could mean a big promotion. On the other hand, mess things up and you 
can probably kiss your position good-bye. If there's one job that's important 
to your career, this is it.

Then again, if Ornomir's so rich and so concerned about his treasures, he 
probably has all sorts of safeguards already in place to protect them, so you 
shouldn't have anything to worry about. Anyway, thinking too much about the 
potential consequences is only going to give you a headache; best to think 
about this is just another job and do your usual thorough work.

So, after an uneventful journey, you arrive at Ornomir's door, ready for

Father is off to Oxford again, and Mother's gone with him.  You know what that

Aunt Emma, who means well but won't let you do anything fun.  Worst of all,

sermon about one of the less-interesting parts of the Bible while Aunt Emma 
pretends that she wouldn't rather be knitting and Uncle Stephen hides under a

Plus, it's gloriously sunny outside, and you can smell the grass from in here.  
It's just not fair.  All the servants have the day off because Uncle Stephen 
and Aunt Emma don't believe in making people do any real work on Sundays, and 
you can bet that they -- Janet and Morris and Cookie, each of whom is loads 
more fun than Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma put together -- are probably not all 
cooped up indoors in their Sunday best.

Parlour (in the armchair)
The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and cosy on

You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace.  Escape seems most likely 
either east into the hall or north into the dining room.

From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes benignly 
down on the room.

Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible.

Another morning, another Minnow & Mommy class. It all started off normally 
enough, with nervous mothers holding up floatie-armed toddlers in the shallow 
end of the pool. Next came kicking, and bubble-blowing, and screaming... no, 
the screaming is where things started to go awry. Suddenly there was a mass 
exodus of minnows and mommies rushing past you to scramble up the pool steps, 
leaving you face to face with the monster that inspired such panic: a skunk, 
swimming slowly toward you from the deep end.

Fly as thick as driving rain;
And ever again, in the wink of an eye,

You are on your way home to spend Christmas with your family, and what a 
splendid start to the holiday. A first class train ride, from the cold winters 
fog of London, to the clean air of the family home in Torquay.

Sitting in the carriage, across the table from you is Ingrid. Ingrid is your

This first class coach is alive with Christmas spirit; from the excited 
conversation of your fellow travellers, to the brightly coloured Christmas 
presents they have in their luggage. The carriage itself is full of sumptuous

Gillivray is on a rant again. His anger, like an icicle of acid, rotates around 
his place at the head of the boardroom table. It burns Atkins, to your right, 
who "apparently forgot to evolve from the apes," then swings mercifully past 
you, to smite Carter, to your left, who isn't even "up to the level of apes, 
that antediluvian amoeba!"

Gillivray's attention swings back to the middle to focus on you. So he didn't 
forget you after all: "And you, Norton, you're a man, by species at least. 
Which makes your manifold failures all the more despicable! Would you like to 
know the very definition of a shit-eating grin? Look in a mirror, Norton. 
Furthermore--"

There is no mirror. But, with an inward glance, at this moment of overwhelming 
stress, thought twists, buckles. Decades of mental training slough away. You do 
see something, behind your fixed grin. There's that caustic crystal in your 
skull: the dire compulsion of the family curse. For the last century, once the 
curse is activated, where it commands, your family must obey: GO NORTH.

You've been lucky your whole life, but no longer.

Utopia Technologies. Industrial giant, economic powerhouse, the world's 
greatest scientific superpower, and the organisation most responsible for 
eroding civil liberties and personal freedoms. They're an all-powerful 
capitalist megacorporation that you despise completely and utterly, yet you're 
perfectly willing to join their ranks.

The paperwork has been filed, and you're on the way to the California 
Archipelago in a transport shuttle. There's no turning back now. Tomorrow 
morning, you'll be a citizen of Utopia, based in the Arcology -- that 
overcrowded, polluting eyesore of gargantuan proportions. You'll be a mere 
immigrant worker at the bottom of the corporate ladder, but your stomach still 
churns at the thought. Your motives for going may be pure, but that doesn't 
make it easy.

The journey from China has been uneventful, giving you plenty of time to think 
of your upcoming mission, and the massive responsibility that's been placed on 
your slender shoulders.

Civilian Transport Shuttle
As opposed to say, a military or executive shuttle, which would have seats to 
make the trip comfortable and an in-flight holomovie to ease the tedium of a 
three hour flight from Shanghai. Instead, this is the basic civvie model -- 
you're densely packed in a titanium can with over fifty other Chinese 
immigrants. The cabin reeks of sweat but there is nowhere to go, and at this 
altitude, opening the viewing windows would be the queen of bad ideas.

You are Zegrothenus, a wizard of some renown, respected for many potions and 
infamous for a few magical items (but those were experiments in your youth!). 
It was a dark and stormy night when you learned that your wizard's license 
would not be automatically renewed this year; the new Council bylaw required 
all member wizards to invent one artifact every half-decade.

You demanded an explanation. They did not have you specifically in mind, the 
Council said -- the Council being Faluna, Galadel the Fiery, and Jokan -- but 
you knew better. Jokan never liked you ("Earth wizards reek," he had informed

magically sealed the exits! They set up a pouring potion, as if to mock you, to 
illustrate how much time you had left. They even said that such measures were 
required by your penchant for procrastination! The swine!

something else missing. Heaving a deep sigh, you find consolation only in your 
well-stocked library and extensive glassware collection. You will make a 
potion, but which one should you make? The question confounds you; all you can

Laboratory (By the Table)
You are standing in the center of your laboratory, by the circular chest-level 
table that looks like the stump of a tree. On further inspection, however, the 
table reveals that it is comprised of finely-corrugated steel painted and 
shaped to mimic natural wood. The table sprouts upwards like a mushroom, with 
an oak vat crouching beneath its eaves and a ceramic black cover, that at one 
time slid back to allow access to the hollow core. Your glassware spans the 
surface, and a steel band just below the surface provides hooks for tools. 
Suspended from the ceiling horizontally in the center of a rusty chain, a low 
oil lamp provides a bright yellow-gold light.

In addition to all your glassware, the lab table holds: flask one, flask two, 
flask three, flask four, a lead tray and a mortar.

Eri sits on her haunches, right behind you, as if expecting something.

That accursed reddish potion floats in the air, frothy-white vapors escaping. 
Over three-fourths remains.

The bridge, usually bustling with orderly activity, stands eerily empty. There 
are no officers giving orders, no cadets trying to please, just the empty shell 
of the Command Carrier adrift in deep space, crewless, except for you.

Main Bridge
As the Grand Commander of the Xulthe'en Armada you have grown accustomed to 
your place on the Main Bridge, in the eye of the storm, not to this awful 
silence. If it wasn't for the fact that lights are still blinking on the 
consoles and the monitors are still displaying status information, you'd swear 
the ship was dead in space... 

Suddenly, a terrific impact on the ship's port side sends you staggering. 
You're still trying to get your bearings when you hear the ringing sound of 
metal-clad boots from below. A moment later, your worst fears are realized as a 
group of space pirates swarms up the ladder to the bridge. They clearly want 
the ship, and they've never been known to leave a man alive.

>That was a rhetorical question.

You stand there doing nothing as the pirates take over your Command Carrier. 
They show you no mercy, but at least it's over quickly.

...and then you wake up in a cold sweat, slowly realizing that it was just your 
own private nightmare.

It's Christmas Eve. Rather late on Christmas Eve.

Just this afternoon your darling 7-year-old daughter Samantha announced that 
fully a week ago she mailed a letter to Santa Claus asking for Sugar Toes 
Ballerina, the unbelievably sought-after, impossible-to-find fad doll of the 
decade. Unwilling to see little Sam heartbroken on Christmas morning, you 
frantically phoned every toy store in town. Miraculously, you found a shop that 
claimed to have a Sugar Toes Ballerina in stock!

But that was two hours ago -- before the flat tire. Now it's getting dark, and 
icy weather is closing in. The address you were given, on the outskirts of 
town, has proven to be that of a dilapidated and disreputable-looking shopping 
center -- not a modern chrome-and-neon strip mall, either, but a hulking 
two-story structure that looks to be the ill-favored offspring of a fairy 
castle and a canning factory. The shopping center is tucked well back from the 
street among brooding skeletal trees. Other than a few dim yellowish lights 
that show no trace of holiday spirit, the building is shrouded in gloom, and 
yours is the only car in the parking lot.

that direction.

become eternally lost.  Magic is said to work there.  I will be your
eyes and ears.  Direct me with commands of one or two words.  I should
warn you that I only look at the first five letters of each word, so
you'll have to abbreviate northeast to NE for example.  If I say "I
don't understand that!", it may mean that you are using words outside my
vocabulary, or it may mean that what you are asking of me is totally and
utterly inappropriate.  I should also warn you that life in Acheton is
very dangerous, and not for the inexperienced adventurer.  If you do not
come up to this standard, I suggest you try the Colossal Cave adventure
first.
   Furthermore, I should inform you that a masters' section of Acheton
exists, and that you will have to find your own way there.

Please answer yes or no.>  "Greetings Almighty! Allow me to tell you about your world, Aarkland."

Our story begins here.

The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from early morning 
until all that must be done is done. The summer has been good and this winter 
no one will starve. That is what the villagers believe, anyway. In ignorance 
they have turned from you and cannot see the coming darkness. For them 
Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see the truth is no protection against 
evil.

The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You watch her 
treading along the road and when she stops next to the water, you once more 
feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in more than a hundred years 
that has been born with the old power. The youngest daughter to Lorne and Noki, 
this innocent girl searches the sky for your presence. She smiles when she 
senses it and gives you a little wave. She is the last one. The last hope. 

Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance back along 
the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly. Surely she can 
sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She reaches into her rucksack and 
brings out some bread. She nibbles on it without much enthusiasm while watching 
the flowing river, and she waits for you.

The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and "heal" what 
is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a difference. Not without 
guidance. That is where you come in. As the God of this land, you must guide 
her. First, you should send her to the unholy stones to see what the world 
around her is hiding.

Aarkland (End of Village Road)
This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the forest. 
Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river Aarkland. The river 
flows through the forest and divides it in two: To the east is the old forest, 
and to the west is the forbidden forest.

Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by grass and 
brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east. Between the swaying 
grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare to invade what remains of the 
road. A short distance to the southeast is a pile of stones. The stones are 
barely visible above the grass.

The Aarkland river flows past as always.

A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves the 
unpleasant odor away.

It will forever remain one of life's mysteries: why should a simple man like 
yourself get on the wrong side of anybody? 

You are, after all, just a typical accountant. A little sideline romance with 
the secretary (what's she called -- Joanna) is a pleasant diversion from the 
tedium of your nine hour working day. Even your name, Charles Johnson, is 
unremarkable.

Unfortunately, in today's world, security is nothing more than an illusion. 
Predators, sometimes even our most trusted friends, make plans for our 
downfall. Unseen snipers close in, ready to pull the trigger when we least 
expect it.

Perhaps it's just human nature -- everybody has....

Princess Street
The weather has rapidly deteriorated, raindrops bouncing off the slanted 
marquee onto the pavement. Darkness comes early in the winter months, but 
fortunately the street lamps keep this area of the city well illuminated. The 
prospect of the warm lobby of the eight-screen cinema to the west becomes more 
attractive with each passing second.

You take another glance at your watch: twenty minutes to seven. Glancing up and 
down the street, the only pedestrian you see is a down and out disappearing 
into an alleyway. Where is she?

You had arranged to meet Joanna at half past to see a movie, and possibly a 
romantic dinner afterwards. It came as a relief when she accepted your 
invitation, with all the attentions that slimy boss of yours, Keith, has been 
giving her lately. Now you're beginning to think your short lived luck has run 
out already.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

An orange minibus, part of the late night student service, drives along the 
street without stopping. You catch sight of the large puddle by the kerb just 
in time to dodge out of the way of mini-cascade which follows the vehicle's 
speedy passage through it. Before you can shout any profanities at the driver, 
the bus has become nothing more than a trail of lights in the distance.

Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear to be 
suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the only one in the

buzzing, with the patented Elevated Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain

You have worked at the Institute of Transportation for nearly five years. As 
one of the engineering team in the Research and Development section, it is 
considered a highly respected position and is particularly well paid. In recent 
years it has become even more important, as with a growing population the 
global transport system is struggling to cope. A complete collapse has been 
predicted in a little under five years time.

You are currently working on the Pathway project which is a new developmental 
Rapid Transit System (RTS).  This holds out the promise of fast, efficient and 
cheap travel.  You do not fully understand the science behind it but it has 
something to do with particles, magnetism and time travel. Basically, you 
arrive at your destination the exact same moment you leave your starting point.

The initial trials have been extremely promising and the first long distance 
test is now underway. The intent was for you to be "particled" (as it is 
called) from one side of the planet to the other and then back again. They 
strapped you into a chair situated in the centre of the testing chamber and the 
senior technician on the project gave you the thumbs up sign from the control 
room.  First your hands and feet started to tingle, then your vision blurred, 
then... nothing.

[ The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind

  -- H.P. Lovecraft]

November, 1997.

You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the 
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter 
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to 
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming 
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was 
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and 
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping 
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a 
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move 
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even 
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and 
none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting 
to rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to 
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick 
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of 
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few 
minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of 
settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder 
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be 
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your 
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...[                 * THE FIRST DAY *
  
  I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern
  sea was upon me.

A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle

Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and 
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's 
office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of 
town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

You've always been an outsider. At school, being interested in science, the 
other students didn't want to have anything to do with you. The other boys 
laughed at you, the girls despised you. Your parents didn't understand you. And 
even your teachers were so far below your intellectual level that you couldn't 
have a serious conversation with them! This went so far that you always got bad 
grades, although you were smarter than everybody else - your stupid teachers 
simply never saw it.

Now, after years of restless private scientific research, you've finally 
achieved your goal: You've found the secret of invisibility. Everyone at work 
(you don't know any people outside work) said you were mad when you announced 
your plans... especially your boss who just laughed and said a lowly research 
assistant working at a second-rate university would never be able to do it. He 
only hired you to do the most stupid, repetitive and primitive of work, after 
all. Most of the day, you're forced to clean test tubes. Nobody has ever 
recognised your genius! Now you've proven them all wrong - and you'll have your 
revenge on them! Yes, revenge... the only thing you can think of right now.

Voices of Spoon River

Every cemetery has a plot, a series of secrets that some would prefer stayed 
buried.

This graveyard is haunted. It wouldn't be, except that unresolved issues 
torment Spoon River's former inhabitants and prevent them from resting. 

Your mission is to set these issues right and release the suffering dead. Read 
the epitaphs, talk to ghosts, explore the town and examine objects till you 
find needed clues. 

Good luck! The eternal peace of several souls depends on your determination.

Near a fountain
It seems a bit odd to see a large fountain in the middle of the cemetery, but 
here it stands.  There is a statue of a man in the middle of the fountain, and 
it looks like people toss coins in the water for good luck. Gravesites are to 
the north, south, east, and west.

You can't help but notice that among the pennies and nickels in the fountain 
lies an iron key.

The Story Begins...

     All of the townspeople are seated around the old oaken table at the 
mayor's house. Mayor Mielon sits at the head of the table with Sir Gunther IX 
at his right. You sit behind your master, Borthur the dwarven smith. All twelve 
residents of Windhall have attended the town meeting.
     You listen as Sir Gunther continues his boring oration.
     "...and I begged upon Our Blessed Lord myself that he would but spare us 
just time to better prepare our funds for his approval."
     "What funds?" laughs Denvil the wood elf. "We don't even have half of what 
the village owes in taxes."
     "Thou art such vestile pessilation, thy yonder fop!" spits Sir Gunther 
angrily. "Thou dost not even live within thy city limits."
     "Oh, quit your bawling, Gunther," jeers the jolly wood elf.
     "This is Sir Gunther IX, and thous shaltith addresseth me as such!"
     Your master, Borthur, lets out a little snore in his dozing. You give him 
a slight nudge, and he starts out of his sleep, nearly knocking his chair out 
from under him.
     "And you, yon thief," Sir Gunther continues accusingly. "I'd bet thee a 
fair gold piece thou art holding out on thy funds."
     Kytan, the town trader and well-known thief, glares from under the hood of 
his robe at the flustered knight.
     "I have given just as much as anyone else at this table. If I have more 
left over, that is simply because I am a much wiser businessman."
     Before Sir Gunther can launch himself into another personal assault, Mayor 
Mielon's wife, Idah, stands to address him.
     "Well, what happened, Sir Gunther? Did Lord Osrich give us more time or 
not?"
     "Our Lord said that we hast had enough time to get our affairs in order. 
We need the money in one week, or this town and land shall be forfeited 
forthright."
     "What are we to do?" cries Mayor Mielon.
     At this time the fighter Midknight leans forward into the light of the 
fire. "Perhaps we do not have enough wares amongst us to pay off the town's 
debt, but there is a way."
     "But what?" ask Baezil the baker and Creston the cleric at the same time.
     "Nostrophidius, do you remember the story of the dragon that used to live 
around here ages ago, gathering treasure in his secret den? What was his name?"
     The old wizard, Nostrophidius, leans forward at being addressed. He stares 
at the group for a few moments before answering.
     "Yes, the dragon..."
     Nostrophidius' step-daughter, Kaela, a young girl about your age, stares 
up at the old man from her spot on the floor near the fire, getting comfortable 
in anticipation of the inevitable story.
     "Two hundred years ago, before there even was a town of Windhall, there 
once roamed a great red dragon on these very lands. Kirizith was his name, and 
all who heard it were stricken with a deep fear in the pits of their stomachs. 
Pillaging nearby villages, he massed together hoards of treasure in his hidden 
lair. The dragon grew in age and in power. Many brave knights sought to do 
battle with the dragon, but all fell before his might. Then one day he simply 
disappeared. It happened, in fact, on the very same day this town was founded. 
Knights marched here and built these same walls in preparation to do battle 
with the beast, but the time never came. To this day neither the great dragon 
nor his treasure has ever been found."
     "Splendid!" exclaims Sir Gunther. "When shall I begin my search?"
     Creston and Baezil look at each other in exasperation. Borthur only snorts 
from behind his beard.
     "You, Sir Gunther?" asks Midknight delicately. "But, should the town be 
attacked while you are gone, who would be here to protect us? You are...much 
needed here."
     Sir Gunther muses this compliment over.
     "Mighty Midknight, thy words are spoken true. My quest doth not lie in the 
discovery of the great treasure, but rather in the safety of the very people 
around this table."
     This draws a chuckle out of Denvil, but Sir Gunther only glares at him.
     "But then who?" cries Mielon. "You, Midknight? You, Nostrophidius?"
     "No, not me," replies Midknight. "I've retired."
     "It won't be me, either," adds Nostrophidius. "I'm twenty years past my 
adventuring age."
     Borthur starts suddenly. You jump back as he rises.
     "What about my apprentice, Aerin? His apprenticeship in smithing has left 
him strong and able, and he has both youth and intelligence."
     Everyone turns to look at the old dwarf. Finally Mielon cuts in.
     "An excellent idea, Borthur. What a fit young lad for the job!"
     "But..." you stammer.
     "Yes, quite excellent," smiles Kytan.
     "But how do you expect him to find the treasure?" muses Idah. "He doesn't 
even have anything to dig it up with!"
     "Ah, I can fix that!" laughs Denvil, eager to help.
     He jumps from his chair and produces from one of the thousand pockets in 
his hugely oversized robes the oldest, most battered shovel you have ever seen, 
which he gleefully hands to you.
     "Well now, you're all set," smiles Mielon.
     Everyone wishes you good luck as the meeting breaks up. Borthur draws you 
aside.
     "Why?" you ask him. "Why me?"
     "Ah, don't worry about it, lad. I'm sure you'll make a fine hero."
     And with that he wanders out the door. Your gaze lingers on Kaela as she 
and Nostrophidius leave to head back to their tower, but Midknight slinks out 
of the shadows to stand in front of you, startling you back into reality. Some 
day you'll figure out how he does that.
     "Aerin, I wish you to visit me one night while on your quest. I may have 
something that will come in handy."
     You stammer out a compliance.
     "I live within the forest southeast of town. I'll be watching for you."
     And with that he turns and walks out the door. You race after him to ask 
him a question, but you find the street empty. Some day you'll figure out how 
he does that, too.

     Well, best to get started on your search...

A small room.  Three men; you recognize only one.

"You, Soteria," says the leader.  "I understand you have an invitation to the 
Celebration of the Night of the Comet."

Heat floods your face.  How does he know that?  "I have an invitation, but I 
wasn't sure-- that is, I wasn't planning--"

"You'll go," he says.

The words die half-formed.  An urgent command overrides your personal doubts.

"What am I to do?"

"Speak to the Physician -- he's one of ours, but we've been unable to speak to 
him of late.  Find out anything he knows about the King's illness.  And protect 
the King."

"From what?"

The leader smiles a little wryly.  "I wish I could tell you, girl.  This is the 
Night of the Comet.  It could be anything."

                    [ Hit RETURN to continue... ]

As you turn to go, one of the others touches your arm.  "How did you get an 
invitation? We've all been trying for months--"

"Someone gave it to me," you say curtly.  "A rendezvous of sorts."

"But--"

"Don't worry, I'll attend to my duty," you say.  Adding, mostly to yourself: 
"The masked man won't be there anyway, I'm sure."  Since he became an outlaw 
shortly after he invited you...

Terrace
A terrace of lunar marble, surrounded by a low balustrade.  It gleams softly of 
its own in the darkening night.

To the west, shallow steps descend to the enclosure of the Square Garden; east 
beckons the brilliance of the Sun Court.

The minister of the moon stands at the far end, gazing upwards.

It is top secret. It is deadly. It is the ultimate war weapon. It smells like 
garlic.
You wake up. You can't anything. You can't remember last night. It smells like 
Garlic all around you. You panic to find that you are in a glass room, about 
200 square meters, without any doors. Beyond the cage, you see a room painted 
entirely white. You hit the glass but it seems to be the hardest glass you've 
ever seen. You moan.

Garlic Cage
There is a strange smell of garlic that infects everything, including yourself, 
growing stronger every second.

There is a small Cardboard piece hanging from the ceiling. It smells like 
garlic.

On the Cardboard Plate is a Rock.

There is a bin here. It smells like garlic.

There is a rusty, old looking wire lying around. It seems interesting - perhaps 
you should take notice of it.

Nobody told you stardom would be this boring. You thought the five-year wait 
just to get into the sky was bad, but at least you had an earth to occupy 
yourself with, humans doddering around like flies - rather amusing flies. You 
haven't seen humans on the moon in forever. You've seen nothing, in fact, but 
the same dull rocks in the same musty craters, and the stars who made it to the 
sky saying don't worry, it'll be your turn soon, everyone gets their chance, 
stay pretty, you should really shine more.

You have to admit, though, he was right. Your turn came. A leap second, your 
time to plunge off this rock into their sky, stop clocks, fulfill a few wishes 
if you must, and dazzle everyone who watches - that, or miss the landing and 
live the rest of your life swaddled by a cold ocean. Your debut: all the stars 
do it.

The sky is cold. Midnight is soon. Leap time.

Moon Crater
Well, it's private, at least. They assured you of this. It's a crumbly gray 
hole dug into a gray field, yes, and the air's choked with dust. You can't move 
without kicking up a new cloud and blinding yourself for a few seconds, not 
that there'd be much to miss. But at least people can't see you here. Even if 
someone down below were to look at the sky when you were out of your trench, 
they'd merely see a shiny speck. Windows get them all the time. Nothing to 
dwell upon.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>Are you sure you want to quit? ZIF quit

The sun shines down on the city of Whitstone, and the great clock in Steeping 
Square strikes four.  Along with just about everyone else in the city, you head 
out to find your afternoon tea.  It's a good thing, too, because you were just 
starting to get the shakes...

Buxenhall Gardens
Buxenhall Gardens is, at least during the summer months, the most popular 
teahouse in Whitstone.  Patrons in fancy dress mill about, exchanging the 
latest gossip and sipping the finest of imported teas.  Numerous tables and 
divans are arrayed about the gardens in a studied fashion: pleasingly 
disordered, yet still allowing easy passage for women in wide skirts.

An unoccupied plush sofa looks quite inviting.

You can also see a bulletin board and a waiter here.

"This is the house, miss," the man from the town says, stopping a good few 
yards from the gate. Even as you thank him, he is walking briskly away - 
shoulders hunched, hands in pockets - and he does not turn around to answer 
you. 

 You peer through the wrought-iron curlicues of the gate and wonder if there 
has been some mistake. This house hardly looks inhabited. All its windows are 
dark. Its paint, whatever color it once was, has faded to a dull greyish shade. 
The posts of the porch railing are broken and jagged, leaning at odd angles 
like a mouthful of crooked teeth. Can this really be the home of your new 
employer? 

 Well, you should at least go up to the house and look. You've come all this 
way, after all. 

 You step through the gate. It creaks shut behind you.

Front Lawn
The tall, browning grass rustles in the chill wind, but there don't seem to be 
any flowers to bring a bit of color to the grey surroundings. A cobbled path 
cuts a narrow slice through the overgrown lawn, leading north to the house, and 
another path, branching off of that one, leads around the side of the house to 
the northwest. To the south looms the front gate.

Oval Office
You are standing inside a White House, having just been elected to the 
presidency of the United States. You knew Scalia would pull through for you.

There is a large desk here, along with a few chairs and couches. The 
presidential seal is in the middle of the room and there is a full-length 
mirror upon the wall.

What do you want to do now?

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>Oh, how we wish you would.
