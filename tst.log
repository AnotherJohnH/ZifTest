The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This 
is bad. This is very bad.

The phone rings.

Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all 
over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies 
to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

Speeding down Montgomery Boulevard
The streetlights are bright. Unbearably bright. You have to squint as hard as 
you can to keep your retinas from bursting into flame.

"Welcome back to the land of the LIVING, bud," Rob says. "You planning to stick 
around for a while or you gonna pass out again? Cause one thing I've learned 
about chicks is that they actually DON'T LIKE IT when you pass out on them in 
the middle of gettin' it on. You hear me? So if that's, like, your PLAN, then 
I'm droppin' you off and showin' up solo."

You don't exactly remember where the day went, but as you listen to Rob rant 
on, bits of it start to float back to you: a day on the slopes, the brisk 
February wind against your face; polishing off a keg back at the lodge; those 
two girls you and Rob had hit it off with, the ones who'd given you their 
address in town. "We all should get together sometime!" they'd said. Of course, 
Rob insisted that by "sometime" they'd meant "later tonight." You hadn't been 
so sure, but then you'd blacked out before you could argue the point.

How Rob came to be driving your car you're not exactly sure. Apparently he 
couldn't wait till you were sober enough to drive it yourself. From the way 
he's weaving all over the road, he also apparently couldn't wait till HE was 
sober enough to drive it, either.

Rob changes the radio station a few times, eventually settling on the station 
you were listening to in the first place.

Monochrome it is. Press a key to begin!

You are Primo Varicella, Palace Minister at the Palazzo del Piemonte. This 
title is unlikely to impress anyone. Piedmont is the laughingstock of the 
Carolingian League, and the Palace Ministry has devolved into little more than 
a glorified (and not even especially glorified) butlership: your duties include 
organizing banquets, overseeing the servants, and greeting visitors. It is safe 
to assume that the War Minister and the Coffers Minister lose little sleep over 
your presence in the King's Cabinet.

But Charles Martel was a Palace Minister, and he turned back the Moors at Tours 
lo these many years ago. His son Pepin was a Palace Minister, and he became 
King of the Franks. It is not unprecedented for Palace Ministers to make 
something of themselves. One might even say it is tradition. All you need is an 
opportunity.

And that opportunity is now.

King Charles was not an old king. Indeed, he had a good forty years left in 
him. Perhaps even fifty. But an assassin's bullet or a well-placed icepick can 
steal fifty years in less time than it takes to say the words. And a sudden 
illness? An illness such as the one King Charles contracted two days ago? 
Perhaps not as quick, but just as effective. For if this letter you've just 
received is correct, just such a disease has claimed the life of the King. This 
leaves the principality in the hands of his son, Prince Charles. Prince Charles 
is five years old. Piedmont, it seems, will be requiring the services of a 
regent for the foreseeable future. And you can think of no better candidate 
than yourself.

Of course, you shall scarcely be alone in seeking the position. The King's 
Cabinet is not a small body. And your fellow ministers will no doubt try all 
sorts of unseemly tactics in their quest for the throne. Some will try bribery. 
Others will employ treachery. A few may even resort to brute force. But would 
Primo Varicella stoop to using one of these methods? Perish the thought! You're 
better than that. You shall employ all three.

It will be an uphill struggle, to say the least. Of those soon to be clamoring 
for the regency, you are among the lowest in rank. But you are not without a 
number of advantages. The drama to unfold will play out in the palace -- your 
palace. Time is also on your side: at present, only you and the Queen know of 
the King's demise. And you've known of his illness for a couple of days now, 
days in which you've hatched a flawless plan. There should be little to stand 
in the way of your ascent to power so long as you put your plan into action 
immediately.

Or at least as soon as this manicure is finished. One must have one's 
priorities.

Salon
You've funneled the lion's share of the palace improvements budget -- and most 
likely the tiger's share as well -- into renovating the salon... not that the 
Philistines you live among are equipped to appreciate it. From the plush 
Quattordici chairs to the handsome volumes in the library to the imported Ming 
tea service to the steward you hired to attend to your grooming needs, this is 
an oasis of taste and comfort in what is otherwise a fairly uncomfortable and 
tasteless building. Ah, well. When you become Regent you'll have greater 
latitude to redecorate. The arched windows overlook the western gardens, while 
the exit leads east.

The steward shapes the final nail with a pair of scissors.

Isn't it always like that? You spent a hot morning chivvying the plow and the 
Bishop up and down the north field. No satisfaction there -- it's just to turn 
in the clover. The view and the Bishop's hind end never change -- a mule's ass 
no matter what you call the mule, and Reverd Pearson has lectured you enough 
about calling him "the Bishop," but you figure he's your mule so you can call 
him what you like -- the mule, that is, not Reverd Pearson -- anyway, a whole 
morning and now it's time to chop the wood, and your good axe has gone missing.

Reverd Pearson would say you're a careless lunkhead who'd lose his ear if it 
wasn't nailed on. You figure he's right, a man of the cloth, but that doesn't 
mean piskeys didn't steal the thing. You know about piskeys.

Cold Iron
A hot summer's tale by Andrew Plotkin ("Lyman Clive Charles")
Release 6 / Serial number 111119 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 
(Type ABOUT for credits and game information.)

Your Front Room
Reverd Pearson says a man's home is his fortress. Your home is two rooms of 
dressed timber, but the roof doesn't leak, so that's fine. Not enough of a 
fortress to keep out the piskeys, though, it seems. The front door is west, and 
east is where you sleep in back.

A maplewood table stands in the center of this room. It's your home's pride 
(though the Reverd has warned you about pride) -- a handsome furnishing that 
your cousin down the road made for you when your house was raised. Every time 
you walk in you're pleased to see it. Only there should be an axe leaning 
against the table's corner, and there isn't.

A battered book is lying on the table, though.

THE DREAMHOLD
A tutorial adventure by Andrew Plotkin. Copyright 2003-4.
First-time players should type "about".
Release 5 / Serial number 041231 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

You wrench your eyes open. Rough grey stone. Grey stone ceiling. Your head 
hurts, and -- You're lying on the floor. You're staring at the ceiling, and 
it's rough and grey, and you don't recognize it.

You roll slowly (smooth cold floor?) and try to sit up. It hurts. You crawl 
upright. The walls, rough stone also, scrape your aching fingers. You can't -- 
there was white agony, felt like raw light tearing you apart. You can't 
remember anything after that.

You can't remember anything before that. Gone. You clutch at memory, and 
there's nothing but empty air.

Cell
This space, barely wider than outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw 
and square from unfinished stone. Only the floor is smooth -- a fine white 
surface beneath your feet. There is a narrow gap in the east wall.

TerpEtude: A Z-machine Interpreter Exerciser
By Andrew Plotkin (erkyrath@netcom.com)
Release 2 / built with Inform v6.11
Tests compliance with Z-Machine Standards Document 0.99.

NOTE: This program does not test everything in the Z-Spec. Passing all the 
tests in this program does NOT guarantee that your interpreter is 
Z-Spec-compliant.

For that matter, this program may have mistakes in it. I don't think it does, 
but you should not assume it is the Fount of All Z-Machineness. If you find 
something strange, check the Z-Spec, check existing interpreters, check 
Infocom's interpreters, and then send me mail if you're still confused.

Your interpreter claims to follow revision 1.0 of the Z-Spec.

Interpreter claims that colored text IS available.
Interpreter claims that emphasized (bold) text IS available.
Interpreter claims that italic (or underlined) text IS available.
Interpreter claims that fixed-width text IS available.
Interpreter claims that sound effects ARE NOT available.
Interpreter claims that timed input IS available.

Interpreter claims that "undo" IS available.

> 6

This tests signed multiplication, division, and modulo operations. All these 
operations are supposed to be signed. (The Z-Spec 0.2 erroneously says they are 
unsigned; this is corrected in 0.99.)

I am assuming the convention that division always rounds towards zero (not 
towards negative infinity), and (A % B) always has the same sign as A. These 
conventions seem to be common among existing C/C++ compilers. The Infocom 
interpreters also follow these conventions. (But they are not guaranteed by the 
C and C++ standards. Those only require that (A/B)*B + (A%B) == A, for all A 
and all nonzero B.)

13 * 5 = 65 (ok)
13 * -5 = -65 (ok)
-13 * 5 = -65 (ok)
-13 * -5 = 65 (ok)
13 / 5 = 2 (ok)
13 / -5 = -2 (ok)
-13 / 5 = -2 (ok)
-13 / -5 = 2 (ok)
13 % 5 = 3 (ok)
13 % -5 = 3 (ok)
-13 % 5 = -3 (ok)
-13 % -5 = -3 (ok)

This aspect of your interpreter appears to behave according to spec.

You wake up. You have no memory of who you are, or where you are, or what you 
have been doing. A peculiarly vibrating, tinny music pours from an invisible 
source. Then you see the tremendous chunk of stone falling towards you...

Okay, so maybe this isn't a serious entry in the interactive-fiction contest. 
Please don't give away the joke to anyone else (on Usenet, or elsewhere.)

If you find that pieces aren't falling on their own (I mean, if they only fall 
when you hit Z or Space) it's not my fault. Not all interpreters support the 
timed-input opcodes.

Hunter, in Darkness
A Cave Crawl by "Dave Ahl Jr." (Andrew Plotkin)
First-time players should type "about".
Release 4 / Serial number 991119 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/9 

Nearly -- nearly. The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your crossbow, 
try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.

>about
"This game was conceived of and fully outlined in early June of 1999."

And it was, too. All that discussion of compassless games, and mazes, and 
whether "Hunt the Wumpus" was really IF, made me giggle. I already had this on 
the drawing board. I didn't start any of that discussion, either -- although I 
contributed a few comments that I knew would turn out relevant.

Hunter, in Darkness came in eighth in the 1999 Interactive Fiction Competition. 
I might perhaps have done better if I'd included a walkthrough, or hints. Never 
know now, eh?

I'm not including hints now, because this is no longer a Competition game. 
Different strictures apply. You can easily find a walkthrough, or ask for help. 
However, I will say this:

No serious mapping is necessary, or even useful, in playing this game. If you 
think you need to start drawing a map, you're wrong.

Type "credits" for full accreditation.

Hunter, in Darkness is copyright 1999 by Andrew Plotkin, <erkyrath@netcom.com>.

    *** SHADE ***
A brief story by "Ampe R. Sand" (Andrew Plotkin)
First-time players should type "about".
Release 3 / Serial number 001127 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Odd, how the light just makes your apartment gloomier. Pre-dawn darkness pools 
in the corners and around the tops of walls. Your desk lamp glares yellow, but 
the shadows only draw your eyes and deepen.

Not much of an apartment, no. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty computer 
shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on a cardboard 
crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the other, with a closet to 
the side. A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it 
halfway works. One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

Your luggage is piled untidily by the door. A potted hyacinth sits beneath the 
window.

You are sprawled on the futon, staring up into that gloom. Your eyes feel 
gritty. But it's too late -- early -- no time left for sleep, anyway. In a few 
hours your ride will arrive.

On the desk are your to-do list and a travel book.

                        [Please press SPACE to begin.]
[ I shall be telling this with a sigh
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -
  I took the one less travelled by,
  And that has made all the difference.
  
  -- Robert Frost, "The Road Not Taken"]

Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of the 
breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia. As if she 
weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their breast-plates red in the 
setting sun, march ahead of the procession and protect you from seeing anything 
unrehearsed. It's a dog's life being an Ambassador.

Watling Street (in the cushioned basket)
The ancient paved road stretches for miles to the south, turning very slowly to 
the northeast along a mossy stone wall. From up here on your elephant's 
wickerwork basket, you're just level with the branches of the old Imperial 
hunting woods inside the wall.

Having been stuck in this cushioned basket with the Lady Amilia every day for a 
fortnight, you're just desperate to get away.

The procession of elephants shuffles on, their enormous soles slapping onto the 
flagstones with a dull, regular boom.

Hot, foul, and dark. How did indoor theater become so fashionable? Well enough 
in spring rain or winter, but not in the thick, dead afternoon of high summer. 
And though Rito and Imita looks very fine, shining with electric moonslight in 
the enclosed gloom, you're much more aware of being crammed in neck-by-neck 
with your sweaty fellow citizens.

Damn the crowd, in truth: your mood was hot, foul, and dark when you sat down. 
Aessa was supposed to meet you here. She's made excuses before, and you don't 
think about what it might mean. Try not to think, rather. Just watch the story. 
One of your favorites. But it's miserably hot, and you just aren't caught up in

Lower Theater (on the bench)
If nothing else, you have a good seat. The stage is only a few rows to the 
north. People are jammed on benches in every direction; you think the aisle is 
somewhere to the west.

The play is into the final act. Rito has finally found out about Imita's 
affair, and he stalks the stage, whipping voice and hands about himself. A 
footfall behind him; he turns, and sees Imita. She backs a step at the force of 
his gaze.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

The players continue....

   Rito:
   How come you, harlot? Dare you come this way,
   your skin yet dark with Tato's shadow's stain?

   Imita:
   Young lord, I will not kneel. And shadowed dark,
   or white with rays of moon or sun or moon,
   my flesh is mine. Or nearly so; I find --

   Rito:
   Say on! What more has hated Tato done?

You shake your head, trying to net your straying thoughts, and catch a flash of 
copper hair. A few rows back, by the aisle -- Aessa couldn't have shown up and not
 seen you, could she? She wouldn't be avoiding you.

On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and 
grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains 
were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with squat 
brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic 
charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks below tenements 
-- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley can conceal 
balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers 
nurtured by who knows who.

This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty brick, and 
you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a handle. 
Maybe you should call it a day.

End of Alley
It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in three 
directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash. (Your guidebook 
warned you: the police are as efficient about litter laws as about everything 
else they do.) You can retreat to the south.

A plain metal door faces you to the east, near the alley's end. It's firmly 
shut.

The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered away from 
it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's just that after 
weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend cook-out isn't the way 
to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is an appealing thought.

None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

Edge Of Meadow
The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer afternoon. A 
stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old wooden bridge stretches 
across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a scrubby hillside stretches upward.

The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are pleasantly far 
off to the west.

The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.

Stream Bank
A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge which 
spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the east rises the 
flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight; two usable trails lead up 
around it, to the south and the northeast.

awake half the night are gone.  The air is cold, and something smells burnt.  
Your master's experiments must be finished, but with what result?

Something hesitates on the edge of your consciousness, the memory of unquiet

"You, Soteria," says the leader.  "I understand you have an invitation to the

Heat floods your face.  How does he know that?  "I have an invitation, but I 
wasn't sure-- that is, I wasn't planning--"

"You'll go," he says.

The words die half-formed.  An urgent command overrides your personal doubts.

"What am I to do?"

"Speak to the Physician -- he's one of ours, but we've been unable to speak to 
him of late.  Find out anything he knows about the King's illness.  And protect 
the King."

"From what?"

Night of the Comet.  It could be anything."

invitation? We've all been trying for months--"

"Someone gave it to me," you say curtly.  "A rendezvous of sorts."

"But--"

"Don't worry, I'll attend to my duty," you say.  Adding, mostly to yourself: 
"The masked man won't be there anyway, I'm sure."  Since he became an outlaw

   Some material in this story may not be suitable for children, especially the 
parts involving sex, which no one should know anything about until reaching the 
age of eighteen (twenty-one in certain states). This story is also unsuitable 
for censors, members of the Moral Majority, and anyone else who thinks that sex 
is dirty rather than fun.
   The attitudes expressed and language used in this story are representative 
only of the views of the author, and in no way represent the views of Infocom,

Moral Majority. (But very few of whom, based on last year's Christmas Party, 
think that sex is dirty.)

Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This 
morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the 
filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue 
self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a 
diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class 
Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.

Deck Nine
This is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It

As in a dream, you see yourself tumbling down a great, dark staircase. All 
about you are shadowy images of struggles against fierce opponents and 
diabolical traps. These give way to another round of images: of imposing stone 
figures, a cool, clear lake, and, now, of an old, yet oddly youthful man. He 
turns toward you slowly, his long, silver hair dancing about him in a fresh 
breeze. "You have reached the final test, my friend! You are proved clever and 
powerful, but this is not yet enough! Seek me when you feel yourself worthy!" 
The dream dissolves around you as his last words echo through the void....

Endless Stair
You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward

shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail.
Your old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.

"It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand 
Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We 
have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, 
never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is 
Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun 
and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. 
Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, 
long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, 
"take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a 
brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use 
whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses 
briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own 
question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out 
of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the 
newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a 
rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In 
the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic 
blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven 
glow.

November, 1997.

You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the 
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter 
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to 
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming 
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was 
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and 
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping 
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a 
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move 
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even 
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and 
none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting 
to rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to 
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick 
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of 
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few 
minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of 
settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder 
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be 
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your 
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...[                 * THE FIRST DAY *
  
  I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern
  sea was upon me.

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle 
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of 
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and 
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's 
office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of 
town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

Copyright 1981  D.J.Seal, J.G.Thackray and J.R.Partington

Would you like instructions?
Somewhere not far away is a passage into a strange and wondrous land
called Acheton.  Many have found vast fortunes there, though some have
become eternally lost.  Magic is said to work there.  I will be your
eyes and ears.  Direct me with commands of one or two words.  I should
warn you that I only look at the first five letters of each word, so
you'll have to abbreviate northeast to NE for example.  If I say "I
don't understand that!", it may mean that you are using words outside my
vocabulary, or it may mean that what you are asking of me is totally and
utterly inappropriate.  I should also warn you that life in Acheton is
very dangerous, and not for the inexperienced adventurer.  If you do not
come up to this standard, I suggest you try the Colossal Cave adventure
first.
   Furthermore, I should inform you that a masters' section of Acheton
exists, and that you will have to find your own way there.
   For a list of useful words and a few general hints, type "HELP".  To
repeat these instructions, type "INFO".

If you have any problems, please contact JGT1, DJS6 or JRP1.
Good luck!

Shall I a tale unfold?

One day, after watching (or perhaps reading) too many Shakespeare
plays, you find yourself wandering around a wondrously enchanted land.
Here they use a richer language than is usual and you come across
scenes which may remind you of certain Shakespearean plays.

How you are going to return successfully to the present day is
something that you will have to find out for yourself but it
may be worthwhile to keep any valuables you come across.

An exhaustive knowledge of the Shakespearean canon is not necessary,
as in most cases just the problems rather than the solutions
are pinched from Shakespeare. Hints are probably available from
JRP1 if you get completely stuck.

For more basic advice, type HELP.
You are standing on a flat plain. From here it seems that all the
world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they
have their exits and their entrances to the north, south, east and west.

DOOMAWANGARA. Abbr: Doom. 

Climate: varies dramatically from desert to jungle, glacier to swamp [N.B. 
Reason unknown; exogeologists baffled]. Atmosphere intensely volatile; 
explorers must guard against rapid corrosion of equipment and spaceship alike. 

Dangers: Atmosphere, as above. Automatic defence system. Also the artefacts, 
reputed to have been the home, aeons ago, of the Ancients; none who has entered 
them has ever returned. 

Special features: The large number of crashed spaceships littering its surface, 
many of which had been carrying treasure from one planet to another, make Doom 
a potentially lucrative source of income for that special breed of explorer 
known as adventurer. 

[Extract from Intergalactic Times, 3,7,187/qbf.] 

You set off from Earth in your one-man ship, and are soon orbiting Doom.
Before you can contemplate a landing, however, your ship comes under a violent 
attack from Doom's automatic defence system. "No wonder most ships never come 
back!", you tell yourself as your ship tumbles out of control towards Doom's 
surface, with you playing the controls like the expert you are.
Nothing you can do can prevent the crash-landing, however, and your ship hits 
the ground with a force that would have killed you had you not jumped up at the 
last moment to absorb some of the momentum... 

You are painfully aware that your ship will corrode away to nothing in Doom's 
atmosphere unless you can take off within 400 turns. Unfortunately, the ship's 
cargo hold now needs replacement equipment:

some dilithium crystals for power (very dangerous to handle) 
a motor unit 
a navigation unit box 
a life support system 
a medikit 
and a nuclear reactor 

Of course, should you be able to pick up the odd bit of treasure while you're 
getting these, nobody - least of all you - is likely to complain. 
The clock is ticking!

Control room
You are standing in what used to be the control room of your spaceship, but 
after the attack it looks more like a junkyard. The only usable exit is north, 
as the others are covered by a delicate patina of squashed solid-state 
circuitry.
A ruined console lies to one side, barely operating. Only one button seems to 
be functional.
There is some explosive on the floor, with a self-igniting fuse.

[Extract from Intergalactic Times, 3,7,187/qbf.] 

The message flashes out across the known universe (and quite a bit of the rest 
of it, too): the planet Doomawangara (Doom for short) is showing increasing 
signs of instability! Its whole solar system is moving erratically - almost as 
if someone (or something) were trying to attract attention... 
Doomquakes,  eruptions, and other quite nasty things are happening on the 
planet's surface, and goodness knows WHAT underneath it. 
To cap it all, another artefact has turned up, not far from a ruined, walled, 
city. The experts reckon that the planet will probably explode in a few days. 
Any sane individual would keep well away. 

You, as the only person ever to survive Doom twice (AND two artefacts!), lose 
no time in preparing an expedition. You have many memories of Doom, and - 
somehow - want to help if you can. 

You, your trusty robot dog, which you acquired last trip (see 'Return to Doom', 
an excellent game even if I say so myself), and a team of three, set out. You 
attempt to land near the artefact, since there is no point in walking further 
than you need. But the ship's navigation is thrown off by what you assume is a 
collection of masscons below the surface. 

The ship plunges downwards, but you and the navigator manage to bring it almost 
to an even keel, and make a safe but bumpy landing. The ground rumbles in all 
directions in an unpleasant manner. You belatedly remember a set of renegade 
robots with whom you had some unfinished business on Doom, too...

taking the ambassador of Regina on an important mission to Fluxo, has just 
crashed on Doom! Ship disintegrating fast! We have left the ship for safety - 
there are only three of us, plus the ambassador, left alive. Rescue needed 
imminently. Please hurry ... heading for cleft ... 

You - as the only person ever to survive Doom (see 'Countdown to Doom' -

After a career of non-trivially heroic actions, you decided to show
the forces of Chaos just who was boss, and so set out to pay them a

transported to another place - you feel sure that it is a convenient

Welcome to the Quest of the Sangraal. This is version 1.18.
All comments and complaints to JRP1, please.
Would you like some background information?
y
The Dark Ages have arrived, and in King Demas's kingdom
the knights of the Chaise Longue have been sent forth from
Castle Moan to redeem the honour of the realm by a quest
for the Sangraal (or Holy Grail). Visions of this mystical
object have been vouchsafed to knights of great purity and
prowess, but, so far, nobody has managed to bring the thing
back for the royal trophy case. It is up to you...
You are standing by the drawbridge in Castle Moan. A
cheering crowd urges you to go out to certain death on
a quest for the Sangraal, as have many knights before you.
The road leads out northwards over the drawbridge.

Please type "inform" for further details.]

Spycatcher version 0.12. (C) J.R. Partington and J.G. Thackray, 1989.

Welcome, agent number 3084.
Do you want to be told the details of your mission?
y
 You have been summoned to MI7 headquarters, popularly known as
'The Zoo' in order to unmask a mole. The chief of MI7, Sir
Arthur Cayley (known to his friends as 'Z') is extremely
worried, because the plans for the new Sonic Macrothrodule are
believed to have been leaked. They were kept in the safe in his
office, and were there yesterday when he came in at 9 a.m.; the
safe had been disturbed when he checked it this morning but the
plans were still there. Z reckons that it would take at least an
hour to remove the plans, copy them, and return them.

 With Cayley is Superintendent Hardy of Special Branch, who has
been assigned to MI7 on special duties for some weeks.

 "We're off for a drink in the 'Cloak and Dagger' now," says Z.
"Take a look round. Because of your unofficial position we can't
openly give you access to the files, but if I were you I'd start
with my secretary's office while she's downstairs -- she'll have
details of my movements yesterday, as well. You can probably
rule out Newton, who is abroad, and Brauer, who's on holiday.

 Nobody else knows you're in the building now that a new
Security guard has come on duty. The guard usually patrols at
about 7 p.m. Don't let anyone see you, or you'll have to abandon
the investigation. Come and find us if you think you have some
useful information. Good luck!"

 Cayley and Hardy are joined by a third person as they go down the stairs.

 Are you ready to start?
y
You are at the Southern end of the first-floor corridor, which
seems to be fairly brightly lit throughout: for security
purposes the lights seem to be fixed to be on at all times.
Three doors confront you at this point, each bearing the name of
their alleged occupants. To the south, the notice says "Sir
Arthur Cayley K.B.E. M.A. Head of Department." To the west, a
similar sign says "Miss Pell. Secretary." and to the east the
notice says "Russell. Accounts" There is further corridor to the
north, with several more closed doors leading off it.

XENOPHOBIA Version 3.7

This is the fourth released version, so should be relatively bug-free.
Please type PLEASE. If you are new to this type of game type HELP.
Should I describe your predicament?
y

You wake up slowly with a frightful headache to vaguely familiar
surroundings. There is a loud and curiously soothing swishing noise in
your ear. After a while you realise that you are on a train, and that
the noise you can hear is your watch as you prop up your head. You are
lying on an entire seat and feel lousy.
Slowly you sit up and look around you. As you do so, someone badtemperedly
occupies the half of the seat you just vacated. You can remember next to 
nothing
about yourself and how you came to be where you are. It is a disturbing 
feeling.
There are various people around, but most of them are showing a deliberate
lack of interest in you. I imagine you are an unattractive sight.
You are in a railway carriage at the end furthest from the destination
of the train. The main passageway continues through a black, rickety
connecting tunnel into another carriage.
You are facing the same way as the train.
There is a copper-coloured Yale key here.

Late Thursday night. You've had a hard day and the last thing you need is this: 
shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and you're progressing rapidly.

On to the next aisle.

Interesting... fresh Gnocchi--you haven't had any of that since... Rome.

The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves on either 
side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket, with only the 
brightly coloured aisle markers visible.

You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright plastic bags 
full of pale skin-tone shapes.

There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with sauces.

You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't 
believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence 
instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual 
shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on 
you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least 
Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had 
the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get 
out of this one?

Strict Z Test

According to the Z-Machine Standards Document, "objects are numbered 
consecucutively from 1 upward, with object number 0 being used to mean 
"nothing" (though there is formally no such object)." Hence, it seems 
reasonable that operations on object number 0 should either fail or, if that is 
not an option, do nothing. These tests are written with that assumption.

Please note that whenever a test is flagged as "correct", that only means that 
an instruction returned zero or non-zero (or branched / didn't branch) when it 
was supposed to. Not that it necessarily returned the correct value. If no 
result is written the result was not tested, and the test was only included to 
test the stability of the interpreter.
