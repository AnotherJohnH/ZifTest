You are in a computer lab. It is dark. All around you are computers with 
monitors shut off. The computers are all locked (except one). The only windows 
are to the east. They are covered with blinds that allow little light in. There 
is one door next to the windows, it is locked. There is another door to the 
west. It is also locked.

You can see a desk (on which are a paper clip and a pencil) here.

Vault Antechamber
Wowzers. The Count opted for simplicity and vague elegance in his treasure 
vault antechamber, choosing to dress the walls, floor, and ceiling alike in 
money-green marble tiles delicately flecked with gold. Apart from yourself and 
the stupendously locked vault door to the south, there's nothing here. Except 
for... THE KEYS.

Like so many fallen autumn leaves, an astonishing number of keys litter the 
floor of this antechamber.

Attack of the Yeti Robot Zombies
This is a try-to-win-on-the-first-attempt game. The point of the game is to try 
to win on the first attempt. Or, failing that, to win in as few attempts as 
possible. You are not supposed to use "undo" or "restore" if things are going 
badly. (Though it is OK to use "save" and then later "restore" if you have to 
leave the game for a while. And it is OK to save the game as often as you 
like.)
Get it? Yes or no?

Please answer yes or no.> no

Ok, I will give an example. Say you are playing a game where you start in a 
burning building. If this were a normal game maybe you would want to search the 
building. Maybe you would find things. If you died you could just restart. But 
if you where playing a try-to-win-on-the-first-attempt game, you would probably 
want to run out, otherwise you might burn and die and then you would probably 
not win on the first attempt.
Now do you understand? Yes or no?
n

Well I give up. Just play the game.

Norway 1994. The country is overrun by yeti robot zombies! Death tolls are 
high. The cities are particularly strongly infested, and many people have fled 
to more desolate places. You too have escaped from a city, and have traveled to 
your cabin in Jotunheimen.

a steep tall mountain wall. The door to your cabin is gone. Bullet holes show 
it has been shot away. It must have been done by humans; yeti robot zombies 
don't carry guns.

It's been raining for hours.  You're lost.  After wandering through the wet 
forest for who knows how long, you find yourself standing before an empty 
cabin.  Above the door is a sign that reads "Ahard's Place".  That must be the 
name of the people who live here.  You rap on the door, hoping against hope 
that someone answers.  Nobody does, but the door creaks open against your 
knocking.  Taking a look inside, it appears to be a one-room cabin.  It doesn't 
look like anyone's home. 

You're incredibly grateful to have found the place -- somewhere along the way 
you've torn your clothes, lost your shoes, and even a sock.  It'll be nice to 
be finally get indoors.  Let's just hope whoever lives here won't mind you 
hanging out for a bit.  As you walk in, a feeling of severe despondency 
overwhelms you, though you can't figure out why.  Maybe this isn't such a great 
place to be after all.  Just as you turn to leave, an incredibly strong wind 
blows a heavy boulder in the path of the door, preventing you from escape.  
Shoot!  Now how will you get out before the owner gets home?

Would you like instructions?
Somewhere not far away is a passage into a strange and wondrous land
called Acheton.  Many have found vast fortunes there, though some have
become eternally lost.  Magic is said to work there.  I will be your
eyes and ears.  Direct me with commands of one or two words.  I should
warn you that I only look at the first five letters of each word, so
you'll have to abbreviate northeast to NE for example.  If I say "I
don't understand that!", it may mean that you are using words outside my
vocabulary, or it may mean that what you are asking of me is totally and
utterly inappropriate.  I should also warn you that life in Acheton is
very dangerous, and not for the inexperienced adventurer.  If you do not
come up to this standard, I suggest you try the Colossal Cave adventure
first.
   Furthermore, I should inform you that a masters' section of Acheton
exists, and that you will have to find your own way there.
   For a list of useful words and a few general hints, type "HELP".  To
repeat these instructions, type "INFO".

If you have any problems, please contact JGT1, DJS6 or JRP1.
Good luck!
You are standing on a good road leading northwards to a farmhouse and

An Interactive Mystery by Amanda Tien
Release 2 / Serial number 090111 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Carnival Entrance
The Carnival has an eerie silence to it at night.  A breeze blows a flurry of 
flyers and some broken streamers.  The absence of voices and laughter is highly 
apparent, although it seems that someone has left some of that cheery circus 
music on.  However, it seems out of place in the dark.  Some of the lights 
flicker above you.  What a classy joint.

Of course, a creepy, low-priority carnival is where you get assigned for your 
first mission.  Apparently, an acrobat went missing early this morning.  
Normally HQ would wait 24 hours, but the circus is packing up tomorrow.  The 
Police Department sent you here as their most inexperienced officer...lucky 
you!   All you have with you is your police badge in your front pocket.  Maybe 
you should look for whoever's in charge of this dump.  And you might as well 
show that badge off and get buddy-buddy with everyone you see - who knows 
what's really going on in this place?

In front of you, there is a huge, brightly-colored Yellow Tent.  To the west, 
there seems to be the Midway.  To the east, you can make out an Old Oak.

Yellow Tent
The tent's huge, billowing sides flap gently in the breeze. It seems to be made

Corridor
This short corridor, running from west to east, certainly would not look out of 
place in a 5-star hotel or an old mansion. The walls are reddish-brown and the 
floor and ceiling are wheat-colored. A door is to the west, and another to the 
east. On the northern wall are two doors, one of them to the west, labeled 
"Bedroom" and the other one to the east, labeled "Study". A small picture hangs 
on the southern wall, livening up the room. You do not hear even a quietest 
sound, except for your own silent breathing - a very eerie feeling indeed.

Between the bedroom and the study door rests a small, but comfy-looking couch.

 "Where the fuck am I?"

 You awake from a daze. You are uncertain of where you are in the world and you 
feel like you could be eaten by a Grue at any moment.  But right now you appear 
to be in an old, run down cabin.

Adventure Time
An Interactive Fiction by Derek O'Neill
Release 1 / Serial number 110111 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Old Cabin
The cabin looks like it could fall apart with the slightest movement.  It looks 
like you feel: lousy.

It's a very old cabin.  The roof is saggy and the floor boards creak.  You can 
tell this got a lot of use but was abandoned a long time ago.
You can see:

The cabin door

Kitchen table

On the kitchen table is a note.

A cabinet

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>You open the door and go outside.

Cabin Yard
Upon leaving the cabin, you see that you are in the middle of a freakin' 
forest.

There are a few different paths leading away from the deteriorating cabin. One 
has been recently tavelled on and the others have not been touched in some 
time.
You can see:

Paths leading:

Late Thursday night. You've had a hard day and the last thing you need is this: 
shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and you're progressing rapidly.

On to the next aisle.

Interesting... fresh Gnocchi--you haven't had any of that since... Rome.

The aisle stretches to the north, and back to the south. The shelves on either 
side of you block your view of the rest of the supermarket, with only the 
brightly coloured aisle markers visible.

You have stopped your trolley next to the pasta section, bright plastic bags 
full of pale skin-tone shapes.

There is a brunette woman a few metres ahead, filling her trolley with sauces.

Something inside is telling you to wake up. Part of your mind says "Sunrise approaches." 

Underneath your dream you feel a deep shiver... It is a chime, the bell of a clock-tower. Another follows, and another. You count them, fully awake suddenly, counting them down. Six. Five. Four. Three.

Your eyes close, and your stomach tightens in anticipation. The sheets around you feel very safe.

Two. One.

The first ray of sunlight lances through the slats in the window-blind. It strikes your eyes, and you feel yourself go.

Scaffold in the City Square
Your head is pulled back, held by the rope pressing on your throat. Your toes pivot on a rickety stool, which shakes as your legs shake. The crowd filling the square are chattering like monkeys, but they are just flits of colour in the corners of your eyes. You cannot look round - instead you gaze straight across the Square, to the great dial of the Clock.

Ball Room
Though the room is filled with chatter, and couples still dance late into the 
night, it does not take a trained eye to see that the two parties keep entirely 
to themselves. Almeri to the left, Tanith to the right, barely so much as 
looking at each other except when etiquette demands. A breeze blows through the 
tall windows, the curtains drifting gently to reveal glimpses of the gardens 
beyond, and on the balcony the band still plays.

The kitchens lie to the north, the gardens east and stairs lead up to the 
balcony above. The main doors lie to the south, but you cannot leave without 
your father.

The ambassador's daughter is here, as you had hoped, your heart fluttering as 
you watch her gracefully dancing with the old general.

Her tall slender body, long silver hair and sparkling blue eyes captivate you -

"In ye go!" With a heave and shove, two burly guards in matching green tights

Orchestra Pit, in Midair
The earthen sides of this pit look loose and near the consistency of mud. They 
seem to rush past as the speed of your descent increases.

>Denial won't help you here.

Flailing helplessly, you fall further into the pit...

Orchestra Pit, in Midair
The light from above dims with each passing moment. A large gnarled root from 
some hidden root system protrudes from the side of the pit here.

>Try as you might, you can't seem to move in any direction but down.

Up above, the guard with the hooked nose nudges his companion. "Hey Rob, aren't 
ye supposed to read the fellow his sentence?" The other guard blinks and nods. 
"Quite right, Jim..." He searches for the scroll in the pockets of his tights 
for a few seconds before realizing that they have no pockets. "One 
moment...It's around here somewhere." He disappears from view.

Your face turns an unhealthy green as you fall, and you wonder what ever 
possessed you to audition for the King...

Orchestra Pit, in Midair
Although the bottom is quite dark, you think you are about halfway down the 
pit. The end of a rope is caught in the muddy wall here and the length of the 
rope hangs down about five feet.

>(the muddy rope)
With flailing arms, you reach out for the rope. Luckily, you're able to get a 
grip on one end! Unluckily, the other end pulls out of the mud and you continue 
to fall down the pit.

Rob the Guard returns to the edge of the pit carrying a scroll. He unrolls it 
and begins to read as the wind whips past your ears. "Whereas today is the day 
after yesterday and the day before tomorrow, and whereas I, King Goosen of 
Papoosen have set to this document my seal, and whereas my seal ran off in 
search of fish, requiring me to get another..." The hook-nosed guard elbows 
Rob. "Skip to the end, Rob. Poor fellow's goin' to hit the bottom soon."

The wind runs through your hair like a screaming banshee as you continue your 
descent. If you had it all to do over you would have practiced a little more. 
And learned a different song...

Orchestra Pit, in Midair
You can just barely make out the bottom of the pit, far below you. A small 
outcropping of stone juts from the side of the pit here.

One day, after watching (or perhaps reading) too many Shakespeare
plays, you find yourself wandering around a wondrously enchanted land.
Here they use a richer language than is usual and you come across
scenes which may remind you of certain Shakespearean plays.

How you are going to return successfully to the present day is
something that you will have to find out for yourself but it
may be worthwhile to keep any valuables you come across.

An exhaustive knowledge of the Shakespearean canon is not necessary,
as in most cases just the problems rather than the solutions
are pinched from Shakespeare. Hints are probably available from
JRP1 if you get completely stuck.

For more basic advice, type HELP.
You are standing on a flat plain. From here it seems that all the
world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they
have their exits and their entrances to the north, south, east and west.

                         - Soolin, 'Games'.

Every day the same old grind, working for a miserable sum that only just allows 
for a comfortable existence, in a job with very little satisfaction.  It robs 
all your time, too; time you could fill with the million exciting projects 
flowing through your head.  So what are you going to do to break out of the 
rut?  How are you going to escape from the mire of bureaucracy that intrudes 
into every aspect of life?  Not by buying tickets in the State Lottery every 
week, that's for sure. No sir, the only way is to be bold, one big step.  So, 
you decide to steal five hundred million credits, and now is the point when 
action is required.  Brace yourself and plunge in - run the program on your 
terminal and then buy the exit visas.  But make sure you get your gun out of 
hiding first because today's the day.  It's going to be a big one; a very big 
one.  It almost seems a shame that you have to keep your secrets to yourself.  
But you just can't trust anyone, you know.

Plaza
You are standing in a wide open square in the better part of the LonDome.  
Bright sunlight shines through the white, translucent skin of the Dome high 
above.  All around you, people bustle about on unknown errands, mostly avoiding 
the seedy-looking alley to the south.  A small bookstall lies northeast, and 
stairs lead down to the subsurface shuttle terminal.  The view, however, is 
dominated by the imposing building in the east, it's marble facade soaring up 
to the heights of the Dome.

You can see a security guard here.

Another fine day in the Internet Service provider business. You hang up the 
phone as you complete the order for that brand new MUD you're going to install 
on the server. It's Saturday night right before Easter and in the heart of the 
Spring Break. Your customers are going to love the new game. You'll have it up 
and running in just a few minutes in the nick of time for all those people with 
alot of spare time. You turn to your computer to begin downloading the new game 
file so you can wrap up and go home. Thunder rumbles. A storm is coming.

As you begin to glide your mouse to the top of your browser to enter a URL
there is a flash outside and the lights flicker! Instantly you hear lots of
loud buzzing noises as the many reserve power supplies in your office come to 
life to keep your internet server online. The buzzing stops, the lights stay
on. Satisfied, you enter the URL of the web page you want to visit and hit 
[Enter]. Your browser tells you it is unable to find the server. Impossible! In 
a split second a wave of fear crosses your mind as you realize the one way this 
could happen...

In panic you run into the computer room and it looks like Christmas; Your Cisco 
router, that magical box that puts your server onto the internet, is 
hysterically blinking. Your worst nightmare becomes real: You are an Internet 
Service Provider without the Internet.

come home and hear this on your answering machine:

"Hey man, it's Keith. The pigs finally got me, and if they ever manage to find 
my address book, they'll probably be coming for you too. I can't tell you where 
I've hidden it, for obvious reasons, but if I were you I'd try to find it

Classroom
You're in a typical classroom in the school which was built at the end of the 
Great Depression.  Green blackboards have replaced the old black types and the 
walls, desks and ceiling (where a sprinkler system has been installed) have 
been repainted. The door leading out is west.

You can see a smoke detector, some unfamliar students, Weeze, Mr Strickland and 
a slide projector here.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n
You can't go that way.

Mr Strickland lifts one in a line of Walkmen (a line to which your very own 
Walkman belongs), and says "Now we are going to see how we deal with those who 
violate our 'No Walkman' rule.". Gently, almost reverentially, he places it in 
the jaws of a woodworking vise mounted on the corner of the desk.  He then 
tightens the jaws until the set breaks in half, the sound approximating that of 
bones breaking.  As bits of plastic and mangled parts trickle to the floor, one 
student winces as if the pain were being inflicted on his body.  Strickland, 
well aware of which unit belongs to each student, smiles wickedly at the 
horrified young man.

With gleeful deliberation, Strickland continues the crunching orgy.

You came for quietude and serenity - a break from the pressures of being 
constantly in the public eye. You came for a spiritual retreat: a chance to be 
with your Father, to think about your future lessons, to meditate on the 
problems of the world. And what do you get? You get followed - followed by 
shepherdless sheep, all too eager to be impressed, but not so eager to 
understand! Your miracles never cease, and neither does the attention you get 
because of them. 

Yes, the world here is a hostile place at the best of times. Hunger, famine, 
poverty and uncleanliness are rife. The people are unhappy. The Romans have 
quashed religion: the priests are corrupt and unholy. 

With the power of God inherently vested in you, only you can save the day. 
Up-and-coming leader of the people (and a new religion to boot), your followers 
have... well, followed you! They are weary from the journey and hungry too, but 
being so numerous, it seems only a miracle could possibly feed them all...

When the seventh day comes and it is time for you to return to the castle in 
the forest, your sisters cling to your sleeves.

"Don't go back," they say, and "When will we ever see you again?" But you 
imagine they will find consolation somewhere.

Your father hangs back, silent and moody. He has spent the week as far from you 
as possible, working until late at night. Now he speaks only to ask whether the 
Beast treated you "properly." Since he obviously has his own ideas about what 
must have taken place over the past few years, you do not reply beyond a shrug.

You breathe more easily once you're back in the forest, alone.

Bronze
A fractured fairy tale by Emily Short
Release 11 / Serial number 060503 / Inform 7 build 3K27 (I6/v6.30 lib 6/10N) 

Have you played interactive fiction before? >Please answer yes or no.> 
Some extra command help is provided, though you may turn it off at any time.

Drawbridge
Even in your short absence, the castle has come to look strange to you again. 
When you came here first, you stood a long while on the drawbridge, unready to 
cross the moat, for fear of the spells that might bind you if you did. This 
time it is too late to worry about such things.

An iron-barred gate leads north.

Some options to try (to play without guidance, type novice mode off): 
  look
  examine (X) the castle, the moat, or yourself
  think about a specific room or object to get a clue
  help to see a more complete set of instructions

>(first opening the iron-barred gate)
You shouldn't be able to open it, heavy as it is, but it swings aside lightly 
at your touch. The Beast said that it knows friend from enemy; and the castle, 
at least, still regards you as friend.

Entrance Hall
There is no fire in the big fireplace, and no one is waiting for you here; the 
air is very cold. Over the gate, the old familiar warning sign is painted.

Various passages lead deeper into the castle: north towards the central 
courtyard, southwest to the guard tower, east and west into the libraries, the 
offices, the galleries. Somewhere in this maze, he waits; and he should be told 
as soon as possible that you did return.

An iron-barred gate leads south to the Drawbridge.

Some options to try (to play without guidance, type novice mode off): 
  examine (X) the warning sign, yourself, the open iron-barred gate, or the fireplace

  open or close nothing
  go south, southwest, east, west, or north or go to any room you've visited
  go through the open iron-barred gate
  think about a specific room or object to get a clue
  help to see a more complete set of instructions

>(the open iron-barred gate)
That's fixed in place.

The Chalice Room
The chalice is the pride of the Museum's collection, and this room -- "vault" 
is a more appropriate term, really -- is evidence of that.  There is only one 
exit, to the south, which is sternly watched during operating hours and solidly 
locked at all other times.  This is an "other time," and the heavy metallic 
door looks quite firm.

You see a plinth (on which is a gem-encrusted chalice) here.

Despite the introductory text, this is not a work of interactive fiction. It is 
an abuse of the programming language Inform 7. More specifically, it is a

2008". Individual months from January of A.D. 1 to December 9999 can be viewed, 
but the yearly calendar function is only available for years from 1753 forward.

Even after you ended your studies into the arcane, the nightmares continued to 
get worse.

You see Amaranth in these dreams - a small and distant land that claims some 
vague portion of your ancestry - and the tyrant of a prince who rules it. You 
see everyone you have ever loved, everything you have ever cherished, shrivel 
and wither and fade - touched by his corrupting shadow.

The Red Prince must die. You realise that now.

Only then will the dreams stop.

accompanies the scene to let everyone know that the wearer of the shoe is very 
alluring, indeed. As the camera pans up, it is revealed to be YOU, Ryan Veeder,

Chief Cheddar spots you and rushes over. "Thank Cheeses you're here, Ryan 
Veeder, world's greatest and most attractive detective!" He takes a moment to

"It's the Punster," he continues. "He's taken over the museum! That's why we

"He's set up a collection of pungent punny puzzles in the museum, and if you

Not again! I hate murders early in the morning. Couldn't these bastards just 
murder people during the day or early evening? 

This morning at 4 a.m. I received a call to come here to investigate a murder 
scene discovered late at night. Operator on the phone told me that the Chief 
Inspector has assigned me as the designated detective on the case. This sucks. 

For God's sake it's my birthday today. Why should I be assigned to a case 
exactly the day after I have solved another major case. It took me more than a 
month working on the previous case. 

I had planned to stay home, relax and watch the Prison Break. Ah! life really 
sucks. 

I have arrived to the victim's apartment on the fifth floor. This is a large 
complex with more than 15 stories. There are more than 30 doors in the hallway 
leading to the victim's home. Poor people. I wonder how they live in such a

person here. No one else has arrived yet?. Where are the CSI people? They have 
already ruined my birthday and haven't shown up for work?
  

There is a kitchen north of me, a bedroom on my right (east) and a bathroom on 
my left (west). The bathroom's door is closed.

On the table are a paper and a pen.

>That was a rhetorical question.

Kitchen
This is really an old building. Look at this kitchen. Totally worn out! The 
cabinets are from a century ago. There is refrigerator on the right. A small 
kitchen table and a lot of cabinets.....Let me see.....What else is here.... .

I can see a cabinet (closed) here.

>(the cabinet)
Taken.

(For more information and help, type "HELP".)

Darkness
You are surrounded by black, cold water in every direction.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

Something is wrong. I can't wake up...Am I dreaming? It seems so real.

>You don't see any direction. Only darkness.

And I can't move. Why can't I move? Do I even have a body?

>(water)
You can only feel it. It's all around you, but your body doesn't seem to 
respond.

This feels like water...all around me, but I'm not drowning...I don't 
remember...was I in bed? Who was I? I remember something...normal. I had a 
normal life.

Welcome to Adventure!

Crobe
An adventure game by Jonathan R. Partington (Cambridge University, 1986)
[This translation: version 1.111115 / Phoenix v1.04 / Inform v6.32
Please type "inform" for further details.]

Crobe - version 1.09. Please contact JRP1 in case of trouble.
Welcome to the caverns of Crobe!
Do you want some inside information?
y
You have been summoned to the seaport of Crobe, a town
where much devastation has taken place thanks to an evil
creature called Karg, who is king of a band of trolls. It
is your task to dispose of this menace, who has fled to
a hideaway under the cliffs of Crobe.

You know also of a mighty wizard called the Warden of Crobe,
who may aid you if suitably impressed by your prowess.

Good luck - you will need it!
You are standing on an east-west road which runs between
the walls of Crobe and an impenetrable forest. At this
point there is a gateway north into the town of Crobe.
> quit
Are you certain you want to quit?
y
You scored 10 points out of a maximum of 300.
Fancy another game then?

This file contains hints for Crobe, a text adventure originally written for the 
Phoenix computer system at Cambridge University. Several of these games were 
later published commercially by Topologika, at which point they were given a 
built-in hints system. Crobe was never published this way. The original version 
never had hints, nor does the ZCode conversion which is available at the IF 
Archive. This file intends to remedy that situation.
The hints are presented as a nested menu, more or less like in later versions 
of Infocom's games. They are arranged roughly by game area. As in the 
Topologika games, for some questions you will get a warning before a final, 
explicit hint is given. One Topologika feature which is missing in this file is 
the option to inquire after the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be 
found among the other questions.

Before reading any hints, it might be helpful to get acquainted with some 
typical features of Phoenix games that aren't shared by most other text 
adventures. Note that, as there was no default library, none of these are 
guaranteed, but a lot of code was shared and these features are common.
First, walking about in the dark is often (but not always) deadly, and walking 
from the dark into a lit room is safe. So far, that's normal. Phoenix games 
differ in that they let you take objects in dark rooms, even if you have never 
seen these objects before. This is not just useful; in some games it is 
critical.
Second, turning objects on and off is generally done using just the commands 
"on" and "off". This applies to switches as well as to lamps and suchlike.
Finally, if you walk into a room and don't know how to go back to where you 
were, Phoenix games include the unusual command "back". Be careful, though: 
this does not work in all circumstances. In particular, it is often made 
ineffective in mazes.

Crobe was written by Jonathan R. Partington in 1986.
These hints were written by Richard Bos in 2011, using Inform 6.30.
Inform was written by Graham Nelson in 1993; version 6.30 in 2004.

Control room
You are standing in what used to be the control room of your spaceship, but 
after the attack it looks more like a junkyard. The only usable exit is north, 
as the others are covered by a delicate patina of squashed solid-state 
circuitry.
A ruined console lies to one side, barely operating. Only one button seems to 
be functional.
There is some explosive on the floor, with a self-igniting fuse.

>n

Cargo hold
You are in what used to be the engine room of your ship, only in the landing 
the cargo hold has been concertinaed into it. What's left of the motor will 
not, alas, be responsible for any more flights. There is a port south, and a 
doorway leading northeast to the outside world.
The door to the northeast was jammed on landing and won't open.

This very short interactive fiction game is only an experiment that is born 
from the question: "How many  adventurous ideas and puzzles can be drawn from 
some passages of a literature masterpiece?" 
Which hints, which ideas, to be more precise, can be taken from the Ninth Book 
of the Odissey, the chapter that narrates the famous adventure of Ulysses and 
the Cyclops? Let's see. 

Note: much of the text is taken from Robert Fagles' translation of the Odissey, 
published by Viking Penguin.

But secret I revolved the deep design: 'Twas for our lives my labouring bosom 
wrought; Each scheme I turn'd, and sharpen'd every thought; This way and that I 
cast to save my friends, Till one resolve my varying counsel ends.

Homer, Odissey, Book IX

The Land of the Cyclops
An experiment by Francesco Cordella 
Translation from the italian version by Simone "Sauron" Di Conza.

The Cyclops cave 
"But round the grot we gaze; and all we view, in order ranged our admiration 
drew: the bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd, the folded flocks each 
separate from the rest in pens (the larger here, and there the lesser lambs in 
fence, the new-fallen young here bleating for their dams: the kid distinguish'd 
from the lambkin lies); the cavern echoes with responsive cries. Capacious 
chargers all around were laid. Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade. 
With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store my friends advise me, and to 
quit the shore. Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away, consult our safety, 
and put off to sea. In the cavern, warmt by fire, dust is everywhere, even near 
the great mat of bands, bed of the monster".

Near half a forest on his back he bore, and cast the ponderous burden at the 
door. It thunder'd as it fell. We trembled then, and sought the deep recesses 
of the den. New driven before him through the arching rock, came tumbling, 
heaps on heaps, the unnumber'd flock.

A big rock blocks the entrance of the cave.

In the middle of the cavern there is a beautiful ram, the leader of the flocks.

Your faithful men are here, around you.

It is the day of your wedding. Your family, friends and all your guests are up 
at Mount Mee preparing for the ceremony. Excitement is in the air, everyone is 
chatting about the details you have been planning for months, what will you be 
wearing? Who is making the cake? How will the tables be decorated?

Suddenly you have a sickening feeling in your stomach: You've forgotten 
something important!

You are chatting with your Dad and he tells you that he can provide transport 
for the day if you haven't organised that yet. Of course you have! This is the 
day of your wedding! You called and booked a romantic horse and carriage months 
ago...didn't you? What's going on? As you try to work it out, you find yourself 
staring pensively at your fingernails, they are dirty and rough, but wasn't 
getting a manicure on your to-do-list? None of this makes sense. If you'd been 
following your to-do-list, everything would be done by now.

Something has gone wrong. Looking around, you realise there's still a lot to be 
done but it's too late. This is a disaster.

Your Bedroom
This is a quaint room with white carpets, walls and minimal furniture. A teeny 
veranda pokes out to the north, barely big enough for your slim self to stand 
on. Your Ensuite is east and the bedroom door is southeast.

You can see a dresser and two bedside tables here.

Moving wakes you properly and you suddenly realise you've just woken from your 
worst nightmare. A rush of relief washes over you. It's actually the 22nd and 
you still have a whole week left. Fortunately, none of that really happened - 
but it could. You are determined to do everything in your power to avoid this 
experience. You have one week but you still have A LOT to organise for your 
wedding day. Your top priority is to get your to-do-list and get started...

You sneak through the door. So far so good. It was a smart choice to leave Aya 
behind. She would have just got in the way.

So this is it: The control centre. It is deserted, which is odd. After all the 
trouble you had to go through to get here... The wild Kroppie Kroppie on 
Starmus 7, the endless hassle with the four vending machines from hell, your 
successful reprogramming of the broken doorstop, which helped you vanquish the 
evil JanitorBot... And now you can just walk into the heart of the evil empire 
without any resistance? This is strange indeed.

But you are not one to complain when things are finally getting easy. 
Carefully, you plant the explosives around the room. Emperor Jacklejitt will 
never again be able to use his Psychotronic Strank-Inversor to enslave the cute 
yet intelligent Swoobies. The death of the Swoobie princess still brings a tear 
to your eye. 

Control Centre
Gleaming lights cover the walls. Several big screens are active. Some show the 
surface of strange, unknown worlds. Some display nothing more than stars. A big 
chair in the middle of the room looks like a throne and anyone sitting here 
must look very powerful indeed. It is clear that this is the heart of the evil 
empire. This is the centre of war and destruction. This is the office of 
Emperor Jacklejitt III.

Some explosives have been placed in the room.
A large torture table stands next to the throne.

Planasia, in the Tyrrhenian Sea

Augustus is dead.

He saw this coming; in that last, secret visit he gave you certain warnings 
about using the powers of your House, and the jealousy of Tiberius.

"For I assume," Augustus said, looking like a hollower version of his own 
statue, "that Julia's son does practice the Art?"

You looked back blandly, as your mother taught you. But he was not fooled.

"I will not live much longer," he said. "When the day comes, you must hide your 
strength from Tiberius, or show it overwhelmingly." He began to walk away along 
the shore.

"Perhaps I have none," you suggested.

He turned back. "I have read a few of the books in your study, Agrippa," he 
said, his eyes amused. "The Latin Cypria is very fine; I wish I knew what 
reverse links you made to produce it."

That was the last you spoke with him.

Damnatio Memoriae

Release 5 / Serial number 061008 / Inform 7 build 4A54 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/11N) 

Study with Pears and Pitcher
The walls are painted black with simple architectural motifs, except for the 
cunning panel of three green pears and a pitcher of water. The glass is painted 
so that light seems to fall through it from the window, and the pears are 
luscious enough to eat.

Clemens (your useless slave) is snoring in the corner, oblivious to what is 
about to happen. He is very similar to yourself: strongly built, with aquiline 
features, keenly intelligent, but losing himself in physical outbursts when 
enraged.

A substantial vase, an antique, stands near the window.

There's also a low stool, the sort that things roll under and get lost.

In plain view is your pride and joy, your Phaenomena.

You take a quick glance around the room, noticing everything that might 
incriminate: the old letter, Clemens, the Phaenomena and the painted glass 
pitcher of water.

I beg your pardon?

>no

You can go in and out the window, but otherwise gallivanting around the villa 
is a bad idea. The other rooms are full of soldiers.

Man! You forgot your scout troop entered you in the local Klondike Derby today! 
Your father banged on the door to get you up. There was a bunch of stuff you 
meant to study and pick up, but it's all helter-skelter now.

Your Senior Patrol Leader also dropped some stuff off, too. Something about 
learning to get by, and it's not really cheating but memory aides. All the 
same, if you do too much of it, you'll get caught. He also explains that a 
leader prepares stuff beforehand and pretty much can just WAIT and bark out 
orders once it's all set.

You just showered, and now you only have a bit of time to grab stuff. Your SPL 
reckoned that you could win four of seven events in the Klondike Derby and slip 
by. Any more might be suspicious. Nothing against your leadership skills--just, 
your patrol's too young, and, well, brains-over-brawn only goes so far.

Release 3 / Serial number 120510 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Your Bedroom
It's kind of messy here. You probably don't want to look much at your desk or 
your bed. You probably should just grab what you can and get going before going 
outside.

You can see a roll call list, a Klondike Derby Itinerary, a bag of candy 
wrappers, a pocket trigonometric calculator, a can of Blue River soda, a first 
aid cheat sheet, a small string of knots, a lashings log, and a techno wheels 
kit here.

"Iam excito, non victus, quod oatefacio vestri animus et accipio meus redimio!"

You hear the words faintly above you, the commands infusing some part of you, 
and you wake, and begin clawing upwards.  The rotted wood of your coffin breaks 
easily, and you begin to scratch through the dirt, packed hard over the years, 
rising through the darkness.  A hand breaks through the surface, grabbing at 
the grass as you pull yourself through the dirt, obeying the call to wake and 
to serve...

Wait a minute.  Shouldn't that be patefacio?

Probably, as you don't feel bound at all.  As your head breaks through the 
ground, and you see a young lad, dressed in black with face paint around his 
eyes, smiling widely at your emergence, a thought runs through your rotted 
skull as you regard him.

Don't they teach Latin in school anymore?

Graveyard
The full moon shines down through a high valley in the surrounding mountains, 
illuminating the hardy, though bare trees and the slightly shaggy browning 
grass in this small cemetery.

Your grave is nearby, a bit messy from where you climbed out of it, your large 
gravestone illuminated clearly enough to examine by moonlight. There are other 
tombstones about as well.

The graveyard is ringed by a six-foot iron fence, a massive gated stone arch to 
the north the sole gap. The gates are open, and look to have been that way for 
a very long time.

A darkly dressed young man is here.

>o
Sorry, that can't be corrected.

>n
The goth notices you moving towards the gate and speaks up. "Hey, where are you 
going?" he calls, and you see his hand going to his coat.  You turn to see him 
fingering for his shotgun, and you pause.

The gothic young man nods that round, full skull of his at you. "Good.  My 
first minion.  With a few more, I can rule this piddly one-horse town.  Be 
helpful and stay close, but out of the way while I get another of your brethren 
above ground."

With that, he pulls out some white powder and a clear bag of some thick red 
liquid, turning to a second grave to begin his task again, to summon another 
zombie.  Might even get it right this time.

However, the little snot seems to have forgotten the spellbook at the ground 
near your feet.

You feel hungry.

Reality is so... unreal.

The tangle of observations woven about it, humankind's utter lack of consensus, 
phases it to fit individual desires. Becoming and unbecoming, back and forth 
eternally, as it paradoxically coexists with and within infinite variations of 
itself...

At least, that's what always surfaces in your mind whenever your own perception 
of reality is altered. Which is to say, ten or fifteen times a day. But it's 
your job, working to someday entertain others with new observations, new 
experiences, new realities. And after all, you signed up for the Project (as 
you well remember, even though it was close to five years ago), so you suppose 
it's entirely your fault if you don't like it. Which, when you think about it, 
you realise you do.

Justy's voice reaches out to you from somewhere you can't see. "Okay, this 
should be it. One final test run to check any overload potential, and this 
world is done! I'm starting her up."

A loud CLANK, and the Sphere begins spinning, with you inside it.

"Brace yourself!"

Bright lights.

Pain.

From somewhere off in your mind's distance, a telltale splash.

Then, as the resounding thrums fade, a distorted ripple sweeps your vision 
clear, and all traces of the laboratory vanish from your senses.

All five of them.

Wiped clean, twitching, anxious for new input.

Virtual reality has become reality.

Coral Reef
Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed, glittering 
in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves. 

You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability to move 
your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat, rudder-like 
tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond any known to man -- 
pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but your other senses appear 
strengthened.

perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But    x  Wsswstndd jqgahergg

estimate at max one potential for overload, maybe two. This one isn't all that 
complex, compared to the lab sim. Cynthesiser's got the analysis sweep running 
in the background, so you may feel some slight distortion. It's nothing to 
worry about. Just give us a typical walk -- or should I say, swim? -- through

Dr. Beagle taps on the glass to get your attention.  When you look at him, he

It really does look just like your grandmother's kitchen.  The oven, fridge,

next to the cabinet under the sink, even the kitten wallpaper is the same.  
That motivational poster belongs to the test chamber, though, and has survived 
its every redecoration including "submarine" and "open grave."  The only other 
difference is a photograph over the oven where your grandmother used to hang 
the heads of her enemies (mostly crickets).

Oh, and the observation chamber where Dr. Beagle is watching you through 
two-way glass.  Your grandmother didn't have one of those.

On the counter are a grocery bag, a bucket of wax pears and a ship in a bottle.

Down The Matrix
An Interactive Fiction by Jessica Martin, Carolyn Owens, Grant Schumer
Release 1 / Serial number 120521 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Beginning
I knew something was wrong as soon as we were out on the lake. I was sitting in 
a small rowboat with a girl named Alice and we were talking, she said something 
about chasing rabbits when I got my first real clue that something wasn't 
right--everything flashed in a bright white light and I thought I saw some 
wires in the place of her hand. No, something was wrong. Alice seemed to notice 
it too and I heard her voice change, suddenly it was mechanical rather than 
that of a little girl. "Hm. You weren't supposed to see that." She mused to 
herself seeming mildly irritated. Suddenly everything flashed again and I got a 
glimpse of my real surroundings. 

I wasn't in a boat on a lake with a girl named Alice, I was in a machine of 
some sort, in a program not of my own design. I was sitting back on the boat 
suddenly and Alice was now a mess of wires with code flickering where skin once 
was. I yelled at her, demanded to know what was going on. The half of her face 
that wasn't a mess of code smiled at me darkly. "I can see that I'll have to 
deal with you while I fix this mess." 

Suddenly everything was black. I had the sensation of falling and no idea how 
long it was going to last. Suddenly, it felt as if I collided with something 
and I saw code flickering around me. I was somewhere deep in the program and 
saw the room beginning to form. I seemed to be in some sort of abandoned hotel 
lobby. The building was coming into existence around me and yet it still seemed 
ancient and neglected with small holes in the walls coated in chipped paint. I 
had to try to go somewhere.

>I beg your pardon?

>The Caterpillar frowns and says, "Alright, suit ya'self. I'll be here if you 
change your mind."

>Lobby
The room around me was definitely some sort of old lobby. Rusted chairs were 
clustered around a rotting table and I saw a door on the east side of the room 
that appeared to be closed. It felt as if I was locked in. Walking around the 
room I saw other objects suddenly pop into existence, the lobby desk nearly 
falling on top of me. 

Something of particular interest was a man who appeared suddenly in the corner 
for a brief moment. He had black cat ears and a tail, but otherwise looked like 
any man one might see, he was pale and thin as if he didn't lead the healthiest 
of lifestyles and his clothes appeared to be slightly too big and somewhat 
torn. He glared up at the ceiling and shouted "Hey!" before disappearing again. 

The dimensions of the room kept changing and I was becoming dizzy. One of the 
walls suddenly got closer and my nose was against it. I heard the mechanical 
voice chuckling. She was trying to intimidate me. Worse, it was working. 

"Welcome to WonderLAN, Lewis." The voice said emotionlessly. She continued 
before I could object and tell her that my name was not and never has been 
Lewis. "I'll be trying to fix the glitch you noticed earlier. Because you're 
part of the broken program, you'll be stuck here unless you help me. But don't 
keep me waiting or I might forget to put you back." She paused. "And do try to 
avoid getting yourself killed, that would spoil all the fun of bringing you 
here." 

I looked around the room, submitting myself to be part of the program for the 
time being. It had to be some sort of puzzle, there is no way that it wasn't.

You can see a lobby door, chairs, a sofa, a table and a desk here.

The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. 
"Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice 
you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage 
the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of 
dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just 
arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, 
that's all." 
Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the 
Wise. 
"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. 
Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. 
Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. 
Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front 
of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of 
Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted 
weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly 
place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting 
a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. 
Might get in a lucky hit or something." 
Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to 
be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old 
tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." 
"Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other 
adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just 
happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with 
dangerous dragons or anything else. 
As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all 
quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. 
"Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul 
willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." 
Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey 
and cart and deposited beside a track. 
"Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries 
away. 

Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the

It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels 
and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the

the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far

Village Square
The late-autumn sun struggles to warm the sleepy village of Skry Im. For as 
long as most of its residents remember, the village has been little more than a 
collection of ramshackle cottages and shops at the crossroads of the King's 
Highway and the Way of the Sea. One such ramshackle shop can be found to the 
northeast: Merchant Guy's Specialty Minerals and Archery Supplies. Also there's 
a ramshackle inn to the southwest.

It's harvest season: most of the villagers are out toiling in the nearby farm 
fields.

madness. Yet mere words have a greater meaning that what many consider.

An April night gave way to a May morning as the birds sang happily in the 
breeze. The children were soon to be awake and heading to school. It was a 
matter of no inquiry: it was a Monday, time to return to school.

One father, John Doe, was also getting ready. He should be at work soon.

Time for a fresh start.

You've been slogging towards the goal -- true metasemanticity -- for months. 
Code-logic sparkles in your dreams and mutters in your ears. You've made great 
strides of progress, thrown them away, rewritten, rearranged, refactored -- but 
the contract deadline is crawling down your throat. No escaping that. You've 
got to pull this project together, and soon.

So forget all of the environment modelling, the texture cores, the interface 
splicing. You're going to build on basic physical forces. Like heat, light, 
maybe mass... Make it feel real, in the user's gut.

Workspace
Nothing surrounds you. The virtual space is unbounded and absolutely blank. 
Just the opposite of what you're aiming at, you think wryly.

With a mental flick, you call up the archetype of a force. Pressure, you 
decide. Mathematically simple, but instinctual. The archetype forms before you: 
a simple equation hanging in the workspace.

>You could exit virtual space in a blink. But escaping your obligations is not 
so easy. You'd better stay and work.

You cup your hand around the equation and compile. It shrinks obligingly into a 
small icon, which you take.

This is just what you were hoping for -- a simple principle, from which an 
entire immersive world can grow. Now to drop it in the workspace and see what

It's been almost a month since your parents disappeared. 

One Tuesday, they just didn't come home, and there's been no sign of them 
since. For the University and the rest of the town, the mystery is beginning to 
pall. To those people, it's as if Claire and Scott Colborn suddenly stopped 
existing -- strange and inexplicable, to be sure, but forgettable in the long

But for you it's as if the ground beneath your feet stopped existing, and 
you've been plummeting in freefall ever since. Your brother Austin, though, has 
been a rock through the whole experience, handling the numbing details, the 
endless meetings with useless detectives, even sorting through Mom and Dad's 
lab in hopes of finding an answer. Now you stand outside the lab door, 
clutching his note, hardly daring to hope that such an answer may have arrived 
at long last.

It will forever remain one of life's mysteries: why should a simple man like 
yourself get on the wrong side of anybody? 

You are, after all, just a typical accountant. A little sideline romance with 
the secretary (what's she called -- Joanna) is a pleasant diversion from the 
tedium of your nine hour working day. Even your name, Charles Johnson, is 
unremarkable.

Unfortunately, in today's world, security is nothing more than an illusion. 
Predators, sometimes even our most trusted friends, make plans for our 
downfall. Unseen snipers close in, ready to pull the trigger when we least 
expect it.

Princess Street
The weather has rapidly deteriorated, raindrops bouncing off the slanted 
marquee onto the pavement. Darkness comes early in the winter months, but 
fortunately the street lamps keep this area of the city well illuminated. The 
prospect of the warm lobby of the eight-screen cinema to the west becomes more 
attractive with each passing second.

You take another glance at your watch: twenty minutes to seven. Glancing up and 
down the street, the only pedestrian you see is a down and out disappearing 
into an alleyway. Where is she?

You had arranged to meet Joanna at half past to see a movie, and possibly a 
romantic dinner afterwards. It came as a relief when she accepted your 
invitation, with all the attentions that slimy boss of yours, Keith, has been 
giving her lately. Now you're beginning to think your short lived luck has run 
out already.

your arm as best you can, and sprint for the door. As you run, your foot 
catches on something for a moment and you stumble, but you regain your balance 
quickly and continue your mad dash for the door. Unfortunately, it seems you 
have overestimated your fire resistance (you knew you should've gone for the 
asbestos-lined suit, whatever your concerns about the health risks). You barely 
make it past the threshhold before consciousness escapes you.

As the world goes black, you regret that you'll never say the word 
"procrastinate" again, and that you never apologized for when you were eight 
and you made your younger brother have to be your personal slave. Now it's 
over, you're dead, and you haven't done anything that you wanted.

***There must be another way out...***

Press any key to continue.

Well, this has not been a great day for you. Your shoelace broke, you stepped 
on some gum, someone moved your chair without asking you, and now your 
apartment's been set on fire by your enemies. Which is just one of the job 
hazards that you have to put up with in your line of work, but still, you're 
not really a big fan of things being set on fire. (Unless you're doing it, 
which is only when there's a good cause.) So this is a problem. The flames have 
engulfed most of the room now. You can feel your hair frizzling in the heat. As 
the fire crackles hungrily towards you, you have only moments to decide: what 
are you going to do?

Hideout
You've been operating out of this apartment for months, undercover, 
infiltrating a shadowy organization known only as them. Or they, depending on 
the grammatical demands of the sentence. Anyway, this apartment isn't really 
yours, technically speaking, but you were kind of attached to it and are sad to 
see it meet such a fate.

The smoke makes it ever so slightly hard to see your surroundings, but you know 
that in front of you, to the north, the only door out of this room is blocked 
off by the blaze, and that there's a window behind you.

Against the wall farthest from the flames stands your bed, neatly made.

A photograph lies at your feet, still untouched by the flames.

It's your first day on the job at the Speedy Express delivery company, and 
there's one last batch of cargo to be delivered before you can call it a day. 
You start to wonder whether you followed the directions correctly when the road 
dead-ends at a large body of water. Then you remember the shift supervisor's 
parting words as you pulled out of the warehouse this morning: "By the way, you 
do know how to row, don't you?"

South Shore
You're at the southern shore of a wide river which runs east to west as far as 
you can see. A stretch of fine sand here makes for a scenic, if narrow, beach. 
A wooden dock extends out several feet from the beach into the water. Across 
the river, a hundred yards or so to the north, you can just make out the far 
shore. To the south is the road you drove in on, your delivery van parked off 
on the shoulder.

Tied to one post of the dock is a rowboat.

You can also see a fox, a duck and a sack of grain here.

Must be Tuesday. Same bar, same crowd, except this week its Dick who has 
stumbled up to you, the one side of his face looking like a sledgehammer had 
its way with him. 

 "Hey!" he growls, shoving your shoulder. "Hey! I'm talking to you!" He leans 
down, his breath fuming with anger and booze. He points at the bruise. "Last 
week... Aren't you the guy..." He points at his bruise again. "Aren't you the 
guy who hit me in the eye?" 

 Yep. It's Tuesday. And like every Tuesday, you've got one move to keep this 
guy from hitting you in the eye.

Bar
The local dive, home to local ruffians, including yourself. You're at your 
usual spot along the counter, and everyone else is in their usual spot, except 
for Dick whose breath continues to grace your face in an alcoholic fog.

"I'm telling ya," Dick slurs at you. "All ya need to do is say yes, no, or 
point at the person who hit me." He fists creak as they clench.

The other regulars pay no attention to the standoff at the bar. After all, it's 
a Tuesday.

>I beg your pardon?

>"Well, I need to hit someone," Dick admits, "so it might as well be you." In 
baseball they call a strike a "swing and a miss..." Unfortunately, this is not 
baseball.

Like a dewdrop suspended from a crystalline cocoon, this massive chamber 
emerges from the underbelly of the Hexergon station, exposed to galactic 
stillness and storms. You're isolated in what the Hexergons call the Overlook, 
a translucent, plasticine bubble affixed to the apex of the chamber. It's here 
with a single keypad that the core is controlled. It's also here that the 
experiment went awry.

The reactor core blazes chaotically hundreds of meters below your feet. 
Hundreds of thousands of kilometers beyond the core roils the black hole around 
which the station now holds a tenuous orbit.

The bodies of Ululul and the translator bot lie motionless, both burnt by the 
now uncontrollable plasma bursts.

The reactor core pulses... once... twice... then explodes. The remaining energy 
relays follow suit, dropping from the ceiling in a cascade of fireworks. 
Reality ripples, time wavers... And just as everything is about to end...

There are four people here. They're called: Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and 
Nobody. I don't know why, maybe this is a heavy handed allegory? In any case, 
you have a task that needs to be done. The task is to get a person other than 
Nobody to fetch the MacGuffin. Who do you choose to go get it?

>
You decide not to choose a person to fetch the MacGuffin and so Nobody ends up 
doing it, which was what you were trying to avoid.

    *** Alas! Your task was not completed! ***

You are in a prison that has 32767 cells. The Guv' has said that a new policy 
has been brought in by the Gov'. Due to prison crowding they're offering every 
prisoner the chance to be freed.

In order to decide who gets set free, The Guv' will ask each prisoner which 
cell they choose. The prisoner will then be escorted to that cell where they 
will spend the night.

During the night, a piece of card will be attached to each cell door on which 
will be written the word "keep" on one side and the word "release" on the 
other. The piece of card will start off with the word "keep" visible.

The Guv' will turn around every piece of card so that the word "release" is now 
visible. Afterwards every second piece of card will be turned then every third 
and so on until the last card has been turned.

"I don't make the rules," he says, "I only go to ridiculous lengths to enforce 
them."

If at dawn when all the cards have been turned, the word "keep" is visible on a 
cell door, its prisoner will be forced to live out the rest of their sentence, 
but if the word "release" is visible on a cell door, its prisoner will be 
released.

"Alright, you little oik," says The Guv',"which cell is it going to be?"

>
Picking a number at random, you tell The Guv' that you choose cell number 
"twenty-nine thousand, seven hundred and twenty" to spend the night in.

You are then escorted to that cell where spend a restless night, worrying over 
whether your maths was right. Early next morning, The Guv' comes in and takes 
ahold of your hand. You get an eerie sensation that all your troubles are just 
beginning. You are then blindfolded and led away from the cell.

For saying the first thing that came to mind, you are brought out into the yard 
just in time to see dozens of your fellow inmates freed. They've even given 
some of them instruments!

You're relaxing at home, smoking a pipe when you hear knocking on what sounds 
like a wooden wall coming from the row of five houses opposite your own. You 
can't quite recall which of your neighbours has woodworking as a hobby. 
Fortunately you remember that each house has a unique colour and the owners 
have a unique name, have a unique nationality, play a different preferred IF 
game and have a different hobby. You also remember these facts pertaining to 
your neighbours:

  1.  Moriarty plays The Chinese Room.
  2.  Ellis lives next to the person who is British.
  3.  Ellis lives in the fifth house.
  4.  The person who has a Navy House has a neighbour who plays Lost Pig.
  5.  The person who has a Teal House likes writing.
  6.  The person who likes gardening lives next to the person who has a Green 
House.
  7.  Bernie likes storytelling.
  8.  Shepherd is Italian.
  9.  The person who has a Navy House lives next to the person who likes 
hiking.
10.  The person who is Spanish has a Green House.
11.  The person who is Irish is directly to the left of the person who is 
Turkish.
12.  The person who has a Fuchsia House plays Blue Lacuna.
13.  The person living in the centre house plays Zork.
14.  Evren has a White House.
15.  The person who is Irish plays Child's Play.

So, who is knocking on the wall?

Is it an innocent affection? An irrational obsession? An outright fetish? Or 
just a handy reference point for the term "disposable income"? You're certainly 
not generally given to nostalgia. Whatever the reason, you still enjoy playing 
old video games. Real ones, from back when games were games and movies were 
movies, and they never seemed to get themselves confused.

It's not as if you need a reason. Taking genuine pleasure in something 
automatically justifies it (and, you're convinced, also justifies having caught 
a train to this weird city). You don't have to think twice about the reason for 
which you attend these conventions. There are, put simply, a lot of games 
inside.

So what if all your spending money went to the train ticket? Salivating never 
hurt anyone.

Baer Boulevard
People walk up and down this ribbon of old brick buildings, alternately holding 
hands and giving each other the finger. Since you're on vacation, you try to 
remain patient long enough to take in the sights; but since these are mostly 
made up of the immense hotel to the south, inside which is the convention, you 
find this difficult. Alleys open to the southeast and southwest, and a nearby 
manhole gapes from within caution signs. Amazingly, given their various 
apparent conditions, the passersby seem to be heeding this advice (enough to 
avoid actually falling in, anyway).

(Enter ABOUT for more information, or HINTS as a last resort.)

hands fall by your sides and pause, confused.

A few generations ago, the ancient elven kingdom of Fyleet
fell. Orcs and hobgoblins, some serving the evil deity Demnos,
looted the fortress of Fyleet and took its treasures into
their dark chambers beneath. You are an adventurer of great
courage and some wits, and have arrived in the area having
heard tales of Zygmund, an evil priest of Demnos, a deity
bitterly hated by your own god, Hurgenpor...

If you don't know how to start a game like this, try HELP.
You are in the ruins of the ancient fortress of Fyleet.
Around you lies a thick pine forest, which appears to have been
cleared a bit to your west; there are also paths to the east
and north, while to the south some steps lead down into the ground.

This file contains hints for Fyleet, a text adventure originally written for 
the Phoenix computer system at Cambridge University. Several of these games 
were later published commercially by Topologika, at which point they were given 
a built-in hints system. Fyleet was never published this way. The original 
version never had hints, nor does the ZCode conversion which is available at 
the IF Archive. This file intends to remedy that situation.
The hints are presented as a nested menu, more or less like in later versions 
of Infocom's games. They are arranged roughly by game area. As in the 
Topologika games, for some questions you will get a warning before a final, 
explicit hint is given. One Topologika feature which is missing in this file is 
the option to inquire after the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be 
found among the other questions.

Before reading any hints, it might be helpful to get acquainted with some 
typical features of Phoenix games that aren't shared by most other text 
adventures. Note that, as there was no default library, none of these are 
guaranteed, but a lot of code was shared and these features are common.
First, walking about in the dark is often (but not always) dangerous, and 
walking from the dark into a lit room is safe. So far, that's normal. Phoenix 
games differ in that they let you take objects in dark rooms, even if you have 
never seen these objects before. This is not just useful; in some games it is 
critical.
Second, turning objects on and off is generally done using just the commands 
"on" and "off". This applies to switches as well as to lamps and suchlike.
Finally, if you walk into a room and don't know how to go back to where you 
were, Phoenix games include the unusual command "back". Be careful, though: 
this does not work in all circumstances. In particular, it is often made 
ineffective in mazes.

Fyleet was written by Jonathan R. Partington in 1985.
These hints were written by Richard Bos in 2014, using Inform 6.30.
Inform was written by Graham Nelson in 1993; version 6.30 in 2004.

a built-in hints system. Fyleet was never published this way. The original 
version never had hints, nor does the ZCode conversion which is available at 
the IF Archive. This file intends to remedy that situation.
The hints are presented as a nested menu, more or less like in later versions 
of Infocom's games. They are arranged roughly by game area. As in the 
Topologika games, for some questions you will get a warning before a final, 
explicit hint is given. One Topologika feature which is missing in this file is 
the option to inquire after the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be 
found among the other questions.

Before reading any hints, it might be helpful to get acquainted with some 
typical features of Phoenix games that aren't shared by most other text 
adventures. Note that, as there was no default library, none of these are 
guaranteed, but a lot of code was shared and these features are common.
First, walking about in the dark is often (but not always) dangerous, and 
walking from the dark into a lit room is safe. So far, that's normal. Phoenix 
games differ in that they let you take objects in dark rooms, even if you have 
never seen these objects before. This is not just useful; in some games it is 
critical.
Second, turning objects on and off is generally done using just the commands 
"on" and "off". This applies to switches as well as to lamps and suchlike.
Finally, if you walk into a room and don't know how to go back to where you 
were, Phoenix games include the unusual command "back". Be careful, though: 
this does not work in all circumstances. In particular, it is often made 
ineffective in mazes.

Fyleet was written by Jonathan R. Partington in 1985.
These hints were written by Richard Bos in 2014, using Inform 6.30.
Inform was written by Graham Nelson in 1993; version 6.30 in 2004.

You come around a corner, away from the noise of the opening.

There is only one exhibit.  She stands in the spotlight, with her back to you: 
a sweep of pale hair on paler skin, a column of emerald silk that ends in a 
pool at her feet.  She might be the model in a perfume ad; the trophy wife at a 
formal gathering; one of the guests at this very opening, standing on an empty 
pedestal in some ironic act of artistic deconstruction --

You hesitate, about to turn away.  Her hand balls into a fist.

"They told me you were coming."

Glass
A fractured fairy tale by Emily Short
Release 1 / Serial number 061008 / Inform 7 build 4A54 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/11N) 

The Prince sits awkwardly on the couch, holding his glass slipper and trying to 
keep it from crushing. Lucinda and Theodora have the ends of the same couch, 
and they are taking turns seeing who can bend lowest and show off the most 
cleavage; while the old lady, in her wing chair, carries on about nonsense. For 
instance:

"Do tell me about your father's health," she says, leaning toward the Prince. 
"Is he still ailing? Has the Spanish doctor been able to do anything for him?"

The Prince looks uncomfortable: this line of reason leads directly to the 
problem of heirs. "I believe so, madam," he replies, with a bit of constraint.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
"No!" you squawk. "No no!"

Theodora frowns in your direction.

"It's so fortunate," says the old lady. "That you're of an age -- that is, that 
the King has been so blessed with an heir who can follow in his footsteps when 
the time comes, which we all hope will be--"

Realizing she has led herself into a diplomatic difficulty, she sighs. "God has 
truly blessed our little kingdom."

>n
You can't escape your perch.

"Now I have heard a rumor," says the old lady, pretending that this 
conversation topic just now occurred to her, rather than being the object of 
her determined pursuit for the last half hour. "A rumor that you yourself were 
planning to wed, in the very near future."

Theodora leans closer to the Prince, who tucks his hands more protectively 
around the slipper.

"There are a great many rumors," he says.

You sit at the huge banquet table with the other luminaries who were invited to 
eat with the Queen of France. You glance around and smile contentedly. Finally, 
after all these years you're receiving some recognition of your brilliance, all 
thanks to your invention of the backscratcher!

The Queen, sitting at the far end of the extravagant table, addresses you. "I 
must say, I am very impressed with your creation", she says as she waves a 
backscratcher in your general direction. "What's more, I've made a small 
discovery about it," she proudly proclaims, "It can also be used to scratch 
things that aren't your back. If you would all care to observe!"

All in attendance give her their undivided attention (likely out of a fear of 
upsetting the easily irritable Queen) as she proceeds to use the backscratcher 
on her bottom. A series of impressed "ohs" and "ahs" emanate from the crowd 
followed by a round of applause for the Queen, who sits back down with a 
pleased expression ruling over her face. You decide it's in your best interest 
not to mention that you were already aware of her little "discovery".

"And now is the time for the eating of things!" the Queen cheerfully announces. 
Butlers equipped with handlebar moustaches pour out of every door, and place 
plates in front of each guest. You look down at what has been served and try to 
hide the disgust as you see it's a cheese, truffle, frog legs and snail stuffed 
croissant. You glimpse around yourself and see everyone gorging themselves, 
which frankly makes you feel a little queasy.

So you do what you always do when faced with something that appears too 
horrendous to consume. You ask for some tomato sauce to drench it in.

A chilling silence, colder than ice cream, envelopes the room. The kind of 
silence that makes one reconsider their previous statement.

"Sacr bleu!" the Queen screams, her face as red as the sauce you so foolishly 
requested! "You dare to taint our delights with ketchup? Guards! Lock this 
treacherous cretin in the dungeon while I think of a suitable punishment for 
this crime against the culinary arts!"

As the dungeon door is slammed shut behind you, you hear "She'll decide death 
is too good for this one. They'll get thrown to the mimes for sure."

No, anything but the mimes! They're so tedious! You must find a way to escape!

You'd been soundly sleeping, comfortably, soundly sleeping, when Dr. Todd 
called. He's your thesis adviser, and as such, he holds unconscionable power 
over you, which he uses for, well, whatever he likes, really. "Hagerston," he'd 
said. (You do have a first name, but no, nobody ever uses it.) "You do think 
it's important we apply our brains in a logical way, and not yield to 
mumbo-jumbo and mystification?" You acknowledged this was true. With Dr. Todd, 
a bad idea. The result was you agreed to meet him in front of the Hotel 
Farfalla at 3 AM. There was some reason, perfectly logical according to Dr. 
Todd, for this request, but you can't for the life of you now remember what it 
was.

Front of the Hotel Farfalla
The Farfalla is one of the grand old San Francisco hotels. Not the sort of 
place you'd go on your own. But then you're not here because you wanted to be. 
It's eight stories of still pretty much gleaming white marble, and no doubt a 
room costs as much a night as your apartment does for the month. It was founded 
in 1898 by Luigi Fornoni and this is the second building to bear the name. The 
first was destroyed in 1906 and Signor Fornoni rebuilt in an even grander 
style. You'd got that far on the brass plaque when Dr. Todd showed up. It was 
more than you really wanted to know.

"Well, Hagerston, I'm glad to see you're here in order to accomplish our 
mission."

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
"I am disappointed to note that your usual cynicism and despair has returned."

>n
You're still not sure why you agreed to this adventure, but if you tried to 
leave now, Dr. Todd would no doubt tell you it was illogical to begin something 
and not finish it.

Growing Up
An Interactive Fiction by Andy Van Deventer
Release 1 / Serial number 110825 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Emergence
 You feel the strange sensation of being stretched upwards. You are outside at 
present, but you remember little of your past. You only remember being in a 
dark, wet place for a very long time. You are clinging to some sort of 
structure, grass all around you, and dirt below you. There is an entrance or 
portal above you and the structure stretches out to the east and west and ends 
in either direction. A little girl stands in front of you. She watches you 
gleefully as she continues to pour water all over you. You store the water for 
drinking later.  

You can see a little girl here.

I beg your pardon?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n
You can't go that way.

Small red spikes have begun growing all over you. You can probably use them to 
attack things or defend yourself.

Lair
You are wedged comfortably into your lair, relaxing in the cold comfort of a 
stone crevice, the walls worn smooth by years of occupation. Here, the darkness 
is complete, like Mother's comforting, opaque fur. No luminous fungi or glowing 
worms venture here with their harsh, painful light.

Also your eyes are closed.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>We'll just ignore the fact that you possess neither the concept of cardinal 
directions, let alone a compass.

You can't go that way.

Reluctantly, you crack a gluey eyelid to the world. Your head surges with pain, 
and you quickly shut it again.

The whiskey gods were not kind to you last night.

You search your memory for the reason behind this latest drinking binge. This 
proves difficult, because there have been many such nights since you were 
removed from your job as detective on the force. Now it comes back to you. The 
rent being past due on your new office. Marge badgering you about her paycheck. 
Your empty bank account. Your complete lack of clients. The money you owe Jimmy 
Voigt. You wince, not even wanting to think about Jimmy Voigt.

Last night, you took your troubles to ole Johnny Walker and he listened good. 
One drink led to another, and that naturally led to the next. Now you find 
yourself awakening on a cold, tiled floor. You bravely reopen your eyes and see 
that you are curled up at the foot of some private investigator's office door.  
       

Hey! It's your office!!

The one you owe rent on... You wince again. Ignoring the warning bells going

        PLOT INTRODUCTION

        A long time ago, when mystics, warriors and villagers 
        with smelly socks roamed the land, things were great. 
        You could slay dragons, beat up no-good thieves, and 
        even go on adventures with your drinking buddies. To 
        add to it all, there was a princess to chase after and 
        a king to swear allegiance to. All in all, life was 
        grand. 

        Until one day, that is...An evil dragon has taken refuge 
        in a nearby cave. As the King's chief dragon hunter, it is 
        up to you to slay the dragon dead. Good luck!

Today is October 31st, 1987. Your friends have invited you to join them for a 
night of camping and partying. The campsite is around a two hour drive from 
where you live now. You aren't sure who the property belongs to, but it's not 
far from where Fred Murks' grandmother lived. You, Fred, and another friend of 
yours named Steve Dirks had made the site as kids before she died a couple of 
years later from pneumonia. You haven't been back since then. It was at least a 
cool place to go when you were too young to be smoking cigarettes because no 
one ever bothered you out there.

Your friends are bringing the camping equipment, food, and beer. It should be a 
fun night. Supposedly some girls were going to be showing up as well, but we'll 
see about that.

You come around one last tight curve and see Fred's car parked on the side of 
the road. It's probably safe to assume that they have already gathered their 
stuff and went to set up camp. You park nearby, and then feel the chilly air of 
the Fall afternoon as you step out of your car and lock the door...

You are at the western end of a primitive stone chapel. Light

reach in the entirely featureless walls of the building.
A plain arch leads northwards to the world outside which,
as you know from experience, is extremely hostile.

Memories, that fuzzy affair. You're never certain enough how true they are to 
reality. I can't clearly remember, just as an example, what rumours said about 
the McDaniel Mansion...

There was something about a stranger who came to visit on a cold Autumn day 
many years ago, just before the house got abandoned for decades.
And then there was the wild speculation about monsters in the basement...

But the thing I really remember from those summer holidays is our  improbable 
and not quite balanced trio of friends. There was Doc. Brown-haired, thin, 
handsome, annoyingly arrogant every now and then, always the charismatic. Then 
there was Rose, shy, with the soft, delicate look under her golden hair. The 
three of us united by the bare fact that we were the only people of our age in 
that too quiet, too boring, village, wasting the best of our late teens during 
the early eighties.

"Now, Mike, I hereby declare you as our official Torch-bearer" solemnly joked 
Rose when giving me the switched off torch that dry, hot late summer evening 
when, just out of having nothing else to do, we decided to play kids and go to 
explore the ruined McDaniel site, as isolated from the rest of the village as 
the village was from the rest of the world...

So there we stood, at the entrance of the old mansion, just the three of us and 
a former elegant door which was as rusty as firmly closed.

I could see Rose and Doc there.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

"A stranger coming out from nowhere causing the house to be abandoned..." said 
Rose. "What an odd story!"

>I couldn't go that way.

"What about those weird noises they say that can be heard from within..." said 
Doc. "As if a monster was buried somewhere in the basement?"
Rose and I looked silently all around and then at each other, trying to grasp 
any suspicious sound. Nothing. Just our own breathing, some far away tweeting 
bird, and... a howling roar coming from our back?
...
"Jeeez" exclaimed a livid Rose while Doc was laughing "You just gave me the 
creeps!"
"Well" he replied "How was that for a buried monster-like creature?"

Is this a (N)ew or (R)estored game? 

Amid the mangled virtual-ware littering this sector, your "Best Help" trophy

In a fit of aftershock, a large console ejects from the other ship. It hurtles 
toward your trophy.

Crash Site

A large piece of equipment hurtles toward your location.

Your trophy's destruction appears imminent.

>Beg your pardon?

>Your consciousness has allocated nearly all of its energies to process the 
recent traumatic events. There's only enough remaining to handle instinctual 
actions.

Twisting slightly from its original course, the console slams into you.

Stunned twice in a matter of milliseconds--that's just not right.

Imitating the ejecting console, the ship that caused this accident seizes its 
better-late-than-never opportunity. You recover just in time to see the 
reference plate of the H. M. S. Co-Dependence disappear into cyberspace.

Why was a Self-Help in this sector?

Since their first appearance on the scene, the Self-Helps have been 
"passive-aggressive" (their term, your opinion). They irritated, but they did 
so from within their own little self-actualized worlds. They were content in 
knowing that you were aware of them, that you were visualizing them shaking 
their heads at your lack of personal integration and weak psycho-social 
interaction. If you wanted your transference patterns, a cognitive analysis or 
just a good old-fashioned kick in the pants, you had to go to them.

Now one of them inflicts a hit-and-run against an innocent, gaming Help Module 
Ship. Was this an accident or the ushering in of a new era, one of active 
consciousness insinuation?

"NNNN nnnn NNNN nnnn..."

The oscillating buzz emanates from your ship through the hatch. The sound 
barely reaches way out here.

Enough contemplation. A player needs assistance immediately.

Ever since that night eight years ago, memories have haunted your sleep: katana 
flashing through the air, your mother's executioner wiping it clean, remarks he 
made to your father as you tasted your first mouthful of seawater.

"A detective with the ACPD, and to think you had my complete trust. We all make 
mistakes, Mister Flint. Yours were to have a wife and daughter. They would have 
lived long, happy lives had you accepted my payoff and walked away."

Drowning (in the Atlantic ocean)
You can't swim. In thirteen years, you never learned how.

Not that it would make any difference. No teenage schoolgirl could hold her own 
against strong Atlantic currents. The swirling waters drag sediments of sand up 
from the seabed. Moonlight filters through the planks of a wooden jetty, one of 
many around Maiden's Wharf.

[Online assistance available by typing HELP.]

>That was a rhetorical question.

You bang your head on a wooden support pole.

>You kick at the water, flapping your arms. Your situation hasn't improved.

>(the Atlantic ocean)
It's the water that's taking you, to your death.

You're starting to see things: a golden horse riding across the ocean, no less. 
The flying animal disappears over the jetty.

Somewhere nearby is Humongous Cave, where others have found fortunes in 
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen 
again. The object of the game is for you to explore the cave and return 
(safely) with as much treasure as possible. The cave is a mysterious and 
magical place. You will face many puzzling and perilous challenges as you 
explore.

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building through a pair

Dr. Sinister is at it again! The Concordance of Powered Response isn't entirely 
clear on what it is he's planning, but it's big and it's based in his island 
fortress. This is clearly a task for one of the world's mightiest champions!

Unfortunately, they've had to send you instead; the world's mightiest champions 
have other emergencies to deal with. New Year's Eve is always rough.

Regardless, this looks by-the-book so far. The containment fields have been put 
in place. Now all you have to do is get over to his island base, infiltrate it, 
defeat him, and bring him in.

You're Tracy Valencia, first-year student at the reasonably prestigious 
University of Dorado. Sure, it's not Berkeley -- hell, it isn't even Stanford 
-- but it's light-years better than Dorado State, where your older brother 
Trevor goes. Dorado State's just a party school. Trevor makes a point of 
rubbing this in every time he calls.

He'll be able to rub it in in person soon enough: it's Thanksgiving Day, and 
you're driving home. Daddy was perfectly willing to buy you a plane ticket, but 
like you told him on the phone, there are much better things to spend the money 
on. Birthday presents, for instance -- you turn eighteen tomorrow. Besides, 
it's only a four-hour drive.

Two and a half hours into said drive, the car starts making a noise no piece of 
machinery should ever make. It's the sort of sound a rhesus monkey might make 
being forced down a garbage disposal. Now, Dorado is nothing but scorching 
desert from the time you cross the coastal mountains until you reach the river; 
true, it's the scorching desert in which you grew up, but sentimentality aside, 
it's not exactly the best place in the world to find yourself stranded. But 
you've got to do something about this noise, if only because it's drowning out 
the stereo. So you pull over. You're just about to switch off the ignition when 
the car goes dead of its own accord. You try to start it up again, but 
absolutely nothing happens.

Guess what, Tracy? You're stuck on the loneliest stretch of Interstate Zero 
miles away from the last sign of civilization. It's twenty minutes to noon and 
the temperature's well over a hundred and twenty. You already miss the air 
conditioning. It's beginning to look like Ed and Sandy Valencia's only daughter 
might not make it for Thanksgiving dinner...

Your plane arrives in Paris at 4pm CET. You've been here before, you know the 
Charles-de-Gaulle airport. After only ten minutes you've rented a car and are 
on your way to Soulac-sur-mer, that little village at the Atlantic coast, about 
60 miles north of Bordeaux.
The five hours drive is boring, but it does give you an opportunity to think 
about how you got here and what you will do when you have arrived at the Kelly 
summer house.
This job is definitely a major one, a big chance for you to make these 10.000 
life-saving pounds without having to work that much for it. Okay, it's true: 
You'll have to be a bit of a burglar to earn the money and, yes, it might be a 
tad dangerous. But who cares? Being a private eye has always been a tough job. 
And you've been through worse things. There's no doubt you'll make this.
You stop at a McDonald's on the way to get you something to eat before arriving 
at your destination. By the time you'll be there, the two children will 
probably be sound asleep and you'll have no trouble getting into the house.
Having arrived at the address given, you get out of the car and have a first 
look at the estate.

ICEWEB by Gil Williamson v0.4

You aren't too happy about this mission. You are an experienced agent, yet 
you've been sent on a trivial errand to contact one of our spies, a job for a 
courier, at best. Still, it's action at last. You haven't been on a proper 
mission for months.

So, you've been secretly dropped from a submarine, in this glorified rubber 
dinghy, with just a few handy items, including a can of shaving foam.

Remember, you are in enemy, or at least hostile, territory here, so be careful. 
The mist is actually helpful, as your small boat is hard to spot on radar, and 
aerial surveillance won't be a threat, either.

Various levels of assistance are available. Type "help".

Aboard a Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB). It's misty and you can't see the shore. 
To the west, you can  dimly see a huge railway bridge crossing the inlet. To

On the RIB are a GPS, a Plastic Box and a NavAssist.

Checkout (on the stool)
I'm sitting on a hard stool, back slouched, fingertips poised to grasp dog food 
cans and punch in numbers on the register. Really though it's so quiet I mostly 
just look out the window. The big clock above the intercom speakers ticks 
slowly.

Before me are the many aisles of the supermarket.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

"This week only: loin of pork, 79 cents per pound," intones the sonorous 
announcer over the intercom.

>(first getting off the stool)
Alas! It's not yet time to leave work.

I will have to get off the stool first.

"Delicious tender surloin steaks, 89 cents a pound," our master of ceremony 
continues.

>(the canned goods)
Nobody's brought any food to the checkout, and as much as I'd like to I'm not 
going to steal the canned goods.

"Lean boiled ham, 99 cents a pound."

After a long day of doing nothing, you sink gratefully into your bed. Sometime 
later, you roll off and drop to the ground with a dull thud. You wake up, and a 
shocking sight meets your eyes - this isn't your room!

What makes things worse is the fact that there are no visible exits... and you 
have claustrophobia...

"Move!" you shout over the storm, shoving the Ambassador into the shuttle then 
slamming the outer door closed, giving the vessel a solid rap when all is 
secure. Backing up a few steps, you immediately lose the craft in the driving 
rain, with only the whine of the engines indicating which way not to go.

You turn away, struggling against rising winds as you retrace your steps to 
your fighter and crawl inside, cringing when the shuttle's premature lift-off 
sends a barrage of stones against your hull. Great, just what you needed - more 
dents.

Skipping preflight, you quickly check your straps, grab the stick and flip the

Credits and Notes

Many thanks to Ola Sverre Bauge, Larry Kwong, and David Glasser for testing. 
Thanks also to Ben Hines, Mary Kuhner, and Marnie Parker for pointing out 
problems in the first release. 

With apologies and thanks to Graham Nelson the developer of Inform for his 
kind, if silent, permission to use bits of the Inform Manual. Also to Andrew 
Plotkin whose genie I have stolen and whose idea I have trivialized. And to all 
those others who have been researched. 

Special mention should be made of Douglas R. Hofstadter and his delightful book 
"Gdel, Escher, Bach" for many of the ideas that underlie this game.

Filthy, battered, itching fiercely from an unrecognized encounter with 
poisonous plants, and nearly exhausted, you have been slogging these bleak and 
forbidding lands for weeks. You drained your account at the Absconders and 
Defaulters National Bank to mount this expedition, and now the gin is running 
out. You don't even want to think about your liver. It may not be worthy of 
exhibit in the British Museum, but the pathology department at the Hot Cross 
Hospital will certainly be interested. 

You feel like weeping; you might as well have stayed by the slit in the stream 
bed and waited for plate tectonics to widen it. You are in front of that all 
too familiar white house again!

West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house.  The front door is not 
boarded up; there is no need. To the right of the door is a small window, 
apparently a recent remodel, which is slightly ajar. 

A rugged path to the west winds into the badlands.

The massive steel front door, which would do credit to a bank vault, is tightly 
closed.

There is a small mailbox here, of course.

Friday night in the little pub around the corner. It is getting late, the 
bartender wants to close, and you are loaded. So you should leave as the last 
customer and walk home. But you want one more drink, and you don't have any 
alcoholic beverages left at home. One last drink tonight!
Note: The story implies a simplified conversation system. Use a command like 
"TALK WITH person ABOUT topic". Each conversation makes use of the verb TALK. 
As there is only one possible dialogue partner, it can be abbreviated: "T 
topic". Enter ABOUT for additional information, HINT to ask for a little help, 
WALKTHROUGH for an explicit description of the fastest way to get a drink.

The characters in this story should not serve as role models. This game is not

Ever since having your first child, you've been finding it difficult to get to 
work on time.  Your boss doesn't seem to care that parenting in itself is a 
full-time job.  He's told you that if you're late to work one more time, you 
may as well not come into work anymore.

Being a parent isn't easy.  Your spouse helps out whenever possible, but you're 
both pretty busy.  Before, all you had to do was wake up, shower, have a cup of 
coffee, and you even had time to read the paper or watch a bit of tv before 
heading to work.  Now, with your 2-year-old, James, it's become a race against 
time just to get both him and yourself in the car.  Fortunately for you, you're 
a parent, and that means you've got the arms of an octopus and have become a 
master at multi-tasking.

You've spent some time calculating how long it takes to get both him and 
yourself ready for the day, and you've figured out that if you don't leave the 
house by 8:00am today, you can say bye-bye to your job.

While walking on the Palace grounds, near a grassy knoll, you notice a shadowy 
figure slipping away at your approach, apparently dropping something as it 
flees. You have no idea which way the figure went, but, walking toward the 
knoll, where the shadow seemed to be, you can't help but overhear your sister 
Dido, the Queen of Carthage, as she speaks to her guest, Prince Aeneas, of the 
fallen city of Troy. From your location near a park bench, you can hear them 
quite well and can even catch glimpses of them now and then, but they probably 
can't see you.

(Right now, first-time readers of this story should probably type
ABOUT.)

Palace Knoll
A secluded green knoll, with a park bench, near the stately Palace of Dido, the 
Queen of Carthage. An overgrown path leads north.

You can see Dido, Aeneas, and a bench (on which is a lamp) here.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>You consider exploring the path to the north, but decide to wait until the 
conversation between Aeneas and Dido is over.

Dido says, in her usual, poetic way,
"Shake the cloud from off your brow,
 Fate your wishes does allow;
 Empire growing,
 Pleasures flowing,
 Fortune smiles and so should you.

 Whence has your great virtue sprung?
 What storms, what battles have you sung?
 Your father's valour mixt with Venus' charms,
 How soft in peace, and yet how fierce in arms!"

August, 1876

"Men!" you snap at no one in particular as you hurry down the sidewalk. Up 
ahead you see Mrs. Jenkins take one look at you and head to the opposite side 
of the street, while Mr. Tutman and Mr. Lester look up from their checker game 
in front of the barber's shop and chuckle.

"Poor Sean..." you hear one of them say as you hurry on by. Poor Sean, indeed. 
They have no idea.

In your mind, you can still hear the investor's patronizing voices. "While we 
are sure you are quite capable, Miss Kelley," one had chuckled, "we really must 
speak with your uncle about financial matters such as these. You do 
understand."

Understand? Oh yes, you understand all too well. Never mind that it's your 
money, that you're the one who's really in charge of the business, handling the 
ordering, the hiring, keeping things running as smoothly as when your father 
held the reins. No, none of that matters. When it comes to talking money, a 
woman's place is... elsewhere. Men.

You stomp up the stairs of your uncle's favorite club, thrust open the outer 
door and step inside, already rehearsing today's lecture on promptness. The way 
things are shaping up, you can tell it's going to be a good one.

Lucky Strike Lobby
Dark stained oak paneling with well-polished brass knobs and rails attempt to 
give this smoky room a dignity it doesn't deserve. Rich detailing aside, this 
is the doorstep to depravity, and the less time you spend here, the better. For 
those who think otherwise, there is a plush red sofa against the far wall, 
positioned directly under a life sized painting of Ulysses S. Grant. To the 
south is an oak door leading outside. To the north is a glass door leading to 
the main room.

Good, the lobby is empty. Moving quickly, you cross the polished oak floor 
toward the inner sanctum door, praying that this time you can extract your 
uncle without making a scene.

"May I help you?" comes Simon's voice from the shadows. Rats. Just once today, 
couldn't something go your way? The doorman tosses a hat and coat on the sofa 
then hurries over, stationing himself in front of the glass door. "I'm sorry

When you spotted this prairie of shoulder-high grass you knew what it was, and 
you were ready for it. You've done this sort of thing before, so you went home 
and picked up everything you could carry, especially things you didn't consider 
good for anything else.

A dreaming, curled up tight, drifts nowhere in a straight line, a ballistic 
path (though gravity's say in the matter is hard to hear above all the noise). 
Half-imagined stories, half-remembered people sail by, fish-eye-lensing, and 
fragmenting into a sonorous black. 

An insistent hand has been shaking you by the shoulder, and though you've 
managed to ignore it all this time, it's suddenly and jarringly unbearable. 
Angrily you turn round and the world shrinks around your face.

'What am I?'

Cold, thirsty, immobile
Queasy yellow light and sour smells -- the acrid plastic smell of synthetic 
clothing and human closeness. You cough, you sweat, you nervously shake, but 
you do not move. You cannot. Something stiflingly close to you, something cold, 
clamps you down.

Now what?
no
Panic floods through you -- you can't even move your head.

This paralysis panics a muffled scream from the back of your throat and it is

You see, when the scientists had thought that the only smallpox around was in a 
very very small box kept securely closed, they were wrong.

When you come into the clinic today, seven people have already died. A nurse is 
missing. He's probably gone, too. You think that his name was Simon.

You're probably gone too, because every time you start talking, your words keep 
running together and together until you start saying dadadadadadadadada and 
then you have to drink some more, so that you can start euthanizing again.

Cinderblocks painted white surround you. The sick smell of disinfectant hangs 
in the stale air. Overhead is a single light that has two settings: dim for 
before, bright afterwards. And off. A steel table, left over from biology 
dissections at the community college, is in the center of the room. It's cold 
in here, but the thermostat near the door says it's 76. The main hallway is to 
the south.

Another victim lies on the steel table. His face is unrecognizable, bloated 
with pustules blooming pink and red. Disease is written all over his body. He's 
naked; it's that much worse.

It's your birthday.

And mother's crying. Just like every year.

Yes, she is allowed to mourn the past, but it is still your birthday and you're 
allowed to be angry about being overlooked.

Plus, grandmother had promised to come and she didn't. Perhaps she was eaten by 
a wolf on her trek through the woods... or perhaps grandmother, too, has 
forgotten about you.

Either way, you have an excuse to get out of the house. Mother can stay here 
and grieve. You'll make a trip into the woods to check on grandmother. You'd 
rather spend your birthday with her anyhow.

Grandmother's always seemed to understand you better than anyone...

Father built this two-room house for a family of four, although it's been just

around this time of year, the place feels too big. You don't remember your 
father; you were very young when the accident happened. You and your brother 
were both very young.

You are in the main living area of your home. In addition to your bed and 
clothes chest, it contains the dining table, four chairs, and the kitchen 
stove. From here you can step out onto the front porch to the east. Your 
mother's grief bleeds in from the north, the door to her bedroom doing little

smell, take, and talk to. The simpler the commands, the better. If you feel you 
are stuck, try asking the characters about things and see what they know. To 
move to a new room, type north, south, east, or west.

Some other controls are:

    Tasks - to see your tasks.
    Save - to save your game.

Kitchen
"Good morning Nibbles. The other mice are all out gathering the last of the 
nuts and berries," Mother Mouse informs you. She is busy in the kitchen as 
always. "Though I don't know how much there is left for them to find, with 
winter being so close. Now then, would you be a dear and go to the bush on top 
of our stump for some huckleberries? There ought to be one or two left, and 
that would be plenty." 

The kitchen is a busy, but well kept place, where mother mouse happily spends 
her time cooking for the rest of the colony.  Baskets of spices, herbs, and 
berries fill the room with the most pleasant of smells.  A boiling cauldron 
hangs over a fire in the back. Mother Mouse is hard at work here. The main hall

...The day after, the local paper remains untouched on his doorstep. A week 
later friends, then neighbours, and then the police search for him in vain. 
After a fortnight, his wife comes to you, begging for help.

Apparently he told some cock-and-bull story about his Grandfather's will and 
set off, determined to hunt around a museum in the middle of the night, with 
only a broken old flashlight he'd found in the attic. Of course, you know that 
makes no sense. Old Edgar Mulldoon isn't dead; you met him last Wednesday.

Which all leaves you, with a dodgy torch of your own, set to find the idiot.

The steps to the imposing front of the museum lead up to the north, shimmering 
orange in the reflection of the streetlamp's light. The facade is dull and flat

The marble walls and floor have fallen into shadow from the overhang, low over

grow right up to you to the east.

The keypad looks a little dead: its screen is dark.

crate is some sawdust.

[ Her lively Looks a sprightly Mind disclose,
  Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those:
  Favours to none, to all she Smiles extends,
  Oft she rejects, but never once offends.
  Bright as the Sun, her Eyes the Gazers strike,
  And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.

My Little Project Concept is Proven
An Interactive Fiction by Jake Johnson
Release 1 / Serial number 120620 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Library
Have a short tutorial!

You can go in a direction by typing "go (direction)". The directions are the 
traditional north, south, east, and west, followed by the slightly more modern 
up, down, left and right, and topped off with upwards and downwards, which 
would be "up the path" and "down the path" respectfully if this program didn't 
confuse those with up and down.

Everything is open but no ponies are here. This is an empty model. The source 
text here contains every official character that would be here, but none of 
them appear.

This is a proof of concept, demonstrating the interactive fiction is wide open 
for massive brony development. It was made within a week of downloading Inform 
7, which is free online and really is that easy to use once you get the hang of 
it.

So, back to describing this library.

A giant structure filled with books on all manner of topics. Upstairs is a 
bedroom, and downstairs is a laboratory.

  I wake peacefully, and already she is there. My angel - she is all around me. 
Her presence is like ice on water. But she is less than peaceful. My thoughts 
are all of raging storm clouds. Hurriedly, I drag myself up.

                          Part I   --   Within

  I've been sleeping up here in the straw for a week now - there's the satchel, 
slung where I used it for a pillow - whilst we hunted, and we gathered. But 
none of that today. The atmosphere of the hay-loft is so dank it is hard to 
make my muscles move with the urgency they need, toward the long ladder down to 
the dusty floor of the barn, and the cattle.

He's up to something. I can always tell. I can just feel it, like a sixth 
sense. I know him that well. In a sense, we have the same brain.

After last night's all-nighter (I had an important report to do for work), I 
intended to sleep all through the day. But I can't afford to do that. Somewhere 
out there, my evil twin is plying his schemes, and I'm the only one who can 
stop him.

My Evil Twin
A Musical Adaptation by Carl Muckenhoupt
Release 1 / Serial number 120322 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 
Type ABOUT for more details and instructions for play.

My Apartment
This studio apartment, located conveniently near work and right across the 
street from the park, serves as my personal headquarters for my hobbies, such 
as doing volunteer restoration work for the local American History Museum and 
foiling the plots of my evil twin. My only real attempt at decoration is a 
framed poster right next to the bookshelf. I can leave to the north.

I can see a presidential figurine and a stack of papers here.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

Outside My Apartment
I'm out on Hill Street just outside my apartment building. It's a beautiful 
sunny day in a quiet residential neighborhood. The street continues east and 
west, and just across it is the park.

The zeppelin lurches suddenly and I tumble forward, spilling my books on the 
deck. Peyton laughs sympathetically and holds out his hand.

"I know you're out of your element, Nicky," he says, as he helps me to my feet, 
"but try to go five minutes without falling over."

I feel myself blushing as I release his fingers. "I'm not used to air travel. 
I'll be better on the... ground."

His sensual lips broaden into a smile. "Not ground, perhaps, but sturdier 
purchase for sure."

I can see it ahead. Rising from the ocean. Just like Peyton, it's striking and 
tall and impossible.

Love, Hate and the Mysterious Ocean Tower
A weird romance by C.E.J. Pacian
Release 2 / Serial number 110510 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 
[If this is your first visit to the tower, type ABOUT and press return.]

Zeppelin
The vast windows of the gondola offer a commanding view of the ruddy sun as it 
sets into the darkening sea. The only landmark in sight is the great Gothic 
tower the airship is tethered to: an incredible stack of columns, arches and 
buttresses stretching far down into the roiling waves.

A narrow gangway leads down to the top of the tower.

The captain watches over the bridge - at least, what parts of it he can see 
over his ample, bushy beard. "The air is calm, sirs," he says. "We should be 
able to hold here 'til sunrise."

Peyton gazes out at the view, arms folded. "Thank you, captain. Trust that our 
mission is an important one, and your vessel shall soon return to the fight 
against the squidmen."

>I beg your pardon?

>There's no question I need to answer at the moment.

I know, I know I know, we're gonna be late. But here's the thing: I'm in a 
coma. Yeah.

And my brain has put together this bizarre fantasy world, to try and keep me 
sane, or protect my fragile psyche from the trauma of... whatever the coma is 
about, and I can't wake up until I escape from the dream-world. And that's 
gonna take a while, because I am really comfortable. I mean in the dream-world 
and also in the real world, right here.

So I don't have a lot of incentive. To wake up, I mean.

Well, if you're gonna be so stubborn about it, you can come in the dream-world 
and solve all the extremely symbolic puzzles and "rescue" me from my delusions. 
I guess it's only fair to let you try.

But hold on. I said hold on! Let me think of a name. For the dream-world. It 
has to be sufficiently fantasy-sounding, but it also has to be obviously 
symbolic of something. Hmm.

Okay, I've got it.

Nautilisia
A bizarre and whimsical dream-world steeped in pseudo-Jungian symbolism, by 
Ryan Veeder
Release 2 / Serial number 130422 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Yeah, it's a stupid name, but it's the best I can come up with.

Stately Manor
Okay, so you start out in this stately manor. It's like stately Wayne manor, in 
that it's on top of a hill, and it's very expansive and full of expensive 
things, but there's no labyrinthine cave system underneath it. There's even a 
big grandfather clock in here, that symbolizes punctuality, but it doesn't tell 
the time. Because it's a dream!

You can go outside by going south. Just because it's a dream doesn't mean there 
aren't still compass directions. Work with me.

>You wanna say something? Or are you thinking?

>(the zig-zaggy pendulums)
The big grandfather clock isn't open.

Welcome to Adventure!

Nidus
An adventure game by Adam Atkinson (Cambridge University, 1986)
[This translation: version 1.140416 / Phoenix v1.04 / Inform v6.33
Please type "inform" for further details.]

NIDUS version 1.0
If any problems, comments, or questions, contact AJFA1
See AJFA1.BOTHER:NOTICE for useful information on known uncured bugs,
and anything else I think useful to publicise.
Would you like some background information ?
y
You are a typical adventuring type - brave, resourceful, and fearless.
After a career of non-trivially heroic actions, you decided to show
the forces of Chaos just who was boss, and so set out to pay them a
visit. As soon as you expressed this intent, however, you were magically
transported to another place - you feel sure that it is a convenient
prison world set up by the Lords of Chaos to store such as yourself.
It seems as though they no longer think to check on its inhabitants, so
perhaps you can escape and destroy your captors, using things brought
to the Nidus over the millennia.
For help, type HELP !
You are in a broderer's room. Presumably some embroidery whiz offended
the Powers That Be sufficiently to warrant exile here. It does not
seem to be at use at the moment, and there is no sign of recent
habitation either. Exits are south-west and north.
A length of silken thread is here. It looks very fine, and is
most likely valuable.
> quit
Are you certain you want to quit?
y
Your score is 5 out of a maximum possible score of 250 points.
Do you want to play again ?

Well, that's got rid of at least one of us then!

This file contains hints for Nidus, a text adventure originally written for the 
Phoenix computer system at Cambridge University. Many of these games were later 
published commercially by Topologika, at which point they gained a built-in 
hints system. Nidus was never published this way. The original version never 
had hints, nor does the ZCode conversion which is available at the IF Archive. 
This file intends to remedy that situation.
The hints are presented as a nested menu, more or less like Infocom's hints. 
They are arranged rougly by game area. As in the Topologika games, for some 
questions you will get a warning before a final, explicit hint is given. One 
Topologika feature which is missing in this file is the option to inquire after 
the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be found among the other 
questions.

Before reading any hints, it might be helpful to get acquainted with some 
typical features of Phoenix games that aren't shared by most other text 
adventures. Note that, as there was no default library, none of these are 
guaranteed, but a lot of code was shared and these features are common.
First, walking about in the dark is often (but not always) deadly, and walking 
from the dark into a lit room is safe. So far, that's normal. Phoenix games 
differ in that they let you take objects in dark rooms, even if you have never 
seen these objects before. This is not just useful; in some games it is 
critical.
Second, turning objects on and off is generally done using just the commands 
"on" and "off". This applies to switches as well as to lamps and suchlike.
Finally, if you walk into a room and don't know how to go back to where you 
were, Phoenix games include the unusual command "back". Be careful, though: 
this does not work in all circumstances. In particular, it is often made 
ineffective in mazes.

Nidus was written by Adam Atkinson in 1986.
These hints were written by Richard Bos in 2014, using Inform 6.30.
Inform was written by Graham Nelson in 1993; version 6.30 in 2004.

Beach
You're on a beach. It's very sandy where you're standing. To the north it 
becomes more watery, primarily thanks to the ocean. Above the ocean is a 
stirring sunset, the kind that would put young couples in the mood for porking 
of the romantic variety. Unfortunately for you, you're on your own. High cliffs 
climb above you to the east and south, and a path winds through small sand 
dunes to the west.

You can see a duffle bag (closed) here.

Your command? I beg your pardon?

Your command? That was a rhetorical question.

Waves gently caress the sand.

Your command? You head into the ocean despite it being rather chilly. When your hips dip into 
the water, your testicles suddenly shoot back into your body which quickly 
persuades you to run back to the beach! Oh, you're a dude, by the way. I hope 
that doesn't make this a sexist game!

Waves gently caress the sand.

Your command? (the duffle bag)
That duffle bag is nothing but a reminder of your shame filled past. Leave it 
here and be free!

Waves gently caress the sand.

Your command? Are you sure you want to quit? ZIF quit

INTRODUCTION
    You are Odieus, son of Odielle of the ancient Winwood family. Coming from a 
long line of sorcerors and enchantresses, you naturally undertook the 
presevation of your ancestric traditions. In Oxvord you majored in casting 
spells and you received you Phd in Effective Cursing and Spell Flinging.
    Just two zifs ago, your bitter archenemy Blackwing son of Blackfeather has 
deviously contrived to seperate you from the most important instrument of your 
field - your magic flingshot. Being an expert Filcher, he has successfully 
executed his evil designs. But you don't panic, you keep calm. Only after 
scrambling through the village yelling at the top of your lungs and frantically 
searching through every nook and cranny for a clue, do you finally decide to 
consult your friend and fellow Flinger, Zinness son of Zinnesess.
    Having reclined liesurely on his plush velvet sofa and chatted comfortably 
for about half a zif, he advises you to pursue Blackwing and obtain eternal 
vengeance. You bravely undertake the mission and declare your absolute 
confidence, but oddly you can't stand up since your knees are shaking too much. 
When you recover, Zinness takes you into his flingroom and transports you 
somewhere near Blackwing's abode; that is, the Pit.

So there you were, walking leisurely towards a garden full of yummy lettuce, 
when out of nowhere this big lumbering boy comes, picks you up, and puts you on 
your back! Now this might not be so bad if you were a worm or dog or something- 
but turtles find a bit of trouble being upside down. This looks to be a 
troublesome day!

Field
The field stretches all around you endlessly, or at least for a few feet, which 
is the extent of your vision. Being as close to the ground as you are makes it 
difficult to see very far. The sky reaches out in all directions below you, the 
soft ground and grass above you, which is an unfamiliar feeling for you, but 
then, you've never been stuck on your back like this before.

This game is very loosely based on a few web searches of the real Ottumwa, and 
watching too much TV. 

The place: Ottumwa, Iowa, population about 25,000 and the county seat of 
Wapello County since 1844. It is historically known as the gateway to southeast 
Iowa because of its access to the Des Moines River and to the railroad. 

You have come here for a well-deserved vacation, to relax away from the 
pressures of your job in the big city.  By trade, you are a skilled forensics 
analyst working for the police department, but today you are planning on 
getting in some good fishing. You need to get a fishing license from the local 
sporting goods store.

You've spent the last few months of your life in a deep, damp pit. Above you, a 
bright light illuminates the pit. The world outside has ignored your plight, 
and the plights of many others.

Every day, the routine has been pacing around the pit. Nothing else to do. 
Sometimes during the day, the guards would lower food down, the word food being 
used loosely, as the food was almost always inedible. Every two days, the hole 
in the middle of the floor where you went to the bathroom would be purged of 
waste, forcing you to endure an awful smell in the meantime.

But today is different. Today, you heard guns. Guns firing, bullets 
ricocheting, incoherent screams. Some time after that, a ladder came down. You 
couldn't see who lowered it. Nervously, you waited a while. Finally, you decide 
it's time to take a chance.

Today, you climb to freedom.

  It's a bright and cold december morning and all the world is snow-white; it 
looks like a landscape right out of a fairy-tale. You're standing here at the 
side of a lake. Boys and girls from the town are ice-skating on its frozen, 
mirror-like surface. However, nobody seems to notice you. Although wish to 
cheer with them; it looks like noone seems to be interested in a young 18 year 
old runaway orphan. So you just stand here and watch them playing, and their 
happiness cuts deep into your heart.
  In the distance, you hear bells chiming solemnly. A married couple walks past 
you, dragging a Christmas tree behind them on a toboggan. A little girl follows 
them, holding a can with Christmas cookies in her hand. Breathing in the 
fragrance of the cookies, her eyes glitter with delight. This all reminds you 
of the sad fact that it's Christmas Eve.

Johann found the whole rattling car empty save one seat occupied by a girl 
about his age, whose face was hidden behind a large folding star chart, labeled 
MAP in one corner. He approached softly. There was something perhaps familiar 
about her.

"Mind if I sit here, Miss?" he asked. She looked up from the map, and Johann at 
once recognized her as his sister, and wondered how in the world he hadn't 
known who she was earlier. She smiled to see him, but he thought he saw her 
wiping a tear from her eye as turned to put down his coat. Taking the seat 
opposite her, and looking for a moment at the near-total desolation outside the 
train, punctuated only by a few swimming blue lamps, he asked, "Where did you 
get that map?"

"They gave it to me at the station, of course. Didn't they give you one too?" 
But Johann could not remember any station. In fact, he could not remember 
boarding the train at all.

This file contains hints for Parc, a text adventure originally written for the 
Phoenix computer system at Cambridge University. Several of these games were 
later published commercially by Topologika, at which point they were given a 
built-in hints system. Parc was never published this way. The original version 
never had hints, nor does the ZCode conversion which is available at the IF 
Archive. This file intends to remedy that situation.
The hints are presented as a nested menu, more or less like in later versions 
of Infocom's games. They are arranged roughly by game area. As in the 
Topologika games, for some questions you will get a warning before a final, 
explicit hint is given. One Topologika feature which is missing in this file is 
the option to inquire after the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be 
found among the other questions.

Before reading any hints, it might be helpful to get acquainted with some 
typical features of Phoenix games that aren't shared by most other text 
adventures. Note that, as there was no default library, none of these are 
guaranteed, but a lot of code was shared and these features are common.
First, walking about in the dark is often (but not always) deadly, and walking 
from the dark into a lit room is safe. So far, that's normal. Phoenix games 
differ in that they let you take objects in dark rooms, even if you have never 
seen these objects before. This is not just useful; in some games it is 
critical.
Second, turning objects on and off is generally done using just the commands 
"on" and "off". This applies to switches as well as to lamps and suchlike.
Finally, if you walk into a room and don't know how to go back to where you 
were, Phoenix games include the unusual command "back". Be careful, though: 
this does not work in all circumstances. In particular, it is often made 
ineffective in mazes.

Crobe was written by John Rennie in 1983.
These hints were written by Richard Bos in 2011, using Inform 6.30.
Inform was written by Graham Nelson in 1993; version 6.30 in 2004.

explicit hint is given. One Topologika feature which is missing in this file is 
the option to inquire after the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be 
found among the other questions.

Before reading any hints, it might be helpful to get acquainted with some 
typical features of Phoenix games that aren't shared by most other text 
adventures. Note that, as there was no default library, none of these are 
guaranteed, but a lot of code was shared and these features are common.
First, walking about in the dark is often (but not always) deadly, and walking 
from the dark into a lit room is safe. So far, that's normal. Phoenix games 
differ in that they let you take objects in dark rooms, even if you have never 
seen these objects before. This is not just useful; in some games it is 
critical.
Second, turning objects on and off is generally done using just the commands 
"on" and "off". This applies to switches as well as to lamps and suchlike.
Finally, if you walk into a room and don't know how to go back to where you 
were, Phoenix games include the unusual command "back". Be careful, though: 
this does not work in all circumstances. In particular, it is often made 
ineffective in mazes.

You came to Livadhia as a pilgrim, looking for Trophonius, for gods and lights. 
 A private consultation.

No luck: the Blue Guide is vague; the man on the street doesn't know what 
you're talking about; and when you tried the periptero where the bus from 
Athens comes to its lurching halt, the owner tried to sell you tickets to the 
Pythia.  "Just eight thousand drachs and no waiting in line!"  

As if the sort of advice you'd get at Delphi would help.  It's all a franchise 
now.

So you set off on your own.  It seemed hopeless, and perhaps it was.  But one 
mis-step in the thigh-deep leaves, and you ended here...

Peacock Chamber
A deep chamber walled in rock.  Light descends steeply from the oculus above, 
leaving a spot of elliptical brilliance on the dusty ground.  The walls are 
panelled, to a height just level with the knee: emerald, sapphire, ovals of 
amethyst, shadowed and dull.

There are two exits: one ceremonial, the vast lintel capped with a triangle of 
empty space, which leads south; the other low and secretive, leading east.

On the altar is a pair of pinking shears.

A heavy metal box has been shoved up against the wall, almost out of sight.

You awaken in total darkness. For a brief moment you are in a state of panic, 
and then your eyes snap open. All that you can see is green, and the occasional 
bubble. Yet that is about to change. The liquid that you seem to be drifting in 
is draining, the volume of it reducing slowly until it drains into the bottom 
of the small container in which you seem to have been housed. You don't know 
why you are here, or even who you are -- but you are awake now. The glass, 
which now has come into view to reveal a roomful of similar cells, some empty, 
some with people floating inside of them, shatters, and you stumble to the cold 
floor.

cell chamber
You are within a chamber full of cryonic cells, where some people are still 
housed asleep. You cannot wake them up, you know -- though you have no memory 
of who you are, you do have memory of the training you were given; though when, 
why, and how you were offered this instruction in whatever it is you were being 
instructed in, you are clueless of. Your own cell has a marker above it, 
reading "830." To your south is a corridor, though you do not know how far east 
or west that corridor goes. 

You might want to pick up the standard blaster.

You're seated comfortably, hunched forward in your armchair. The frame rests on 
your lap, cradled in both hands, the continuing focus of your attention.

You no longer sense change...

In the periphery of your vision you see something of the room - the wood stove, 
a window. Beyond your field of view there is nothing but clutter and increasing 
irrelevance. You're pleased that you'll never have to look on any of it again.

The initial euphoria has subsided. Replaced by a sense of ease, of place, of 
things being, well... right.

It can't be long now...

It's been a bad night. I think I finally struggled into sleep at something like 
half past two, and since then it's been more or less a continuous string of 
nightmares. Time and again I dream of Leo, standing at the end of a distant 
cliff, peering down over the edge. I run towards him, shouting at random, 
trying to warn him---willing to say anything, so long as it reaches his ears. 
But inevitably, just as I am near enough for him to hear my voice, a bell 
sounds from somewhere above us, and he doesn't turn. And then suddenly he is 
gone over the cliff's edge, and the entire world is going white, nothing 
remaining but me, the cliff, and the sound of the bell ringing, and ringing, 
and ringing . . .

Bedroom (on the bed)
I awake with a start, and after a half-second of pure "Where the hell am I," 
place myself in my bedroom. I've no idea what time it is---at least the sun's 
up---but the pounding in my head suggests that it's several hours earlier than 
anyone with any sense ought to rise. The door to the hallway lies to the south, 
and windows border the other three sides of the room.

The doorbell is ringing downstairs. Bloody hell.

>That was a rhetorical question.

The doorbell chimes again. I'm torn between ignoring it and going down to give 
whoever it is the what-for.

>Being unable to fly, I can regrettably only go south.

hours. You are the Gryffindor Seeker, and the game will rest largely on your 
shoulders. Gryffindor needs to win by at least 180 points in order to win the

Slytherin, and their players are excellent. Luckily, the Gryffindor players are 
better. You are in the Gryffindor common room, waiting for the match to begin. 
When you are ready to play, head to the lockers.

You may move places by typing "move to (place)". The places you can move to are 
the Transfiguration Classroom, the Gryffindor lockers, and the Gryffindor

Your eyes attempt to focus. 

You're having one of those still moments that come toward the bottom of the 
whiskey bottle.  Everything is as bleak as it can get.  Lovely, for someone 
like you.  For a fantasy writer your fans rely on to put them in a wondrous 
alternate place.  Right now you'd rather be in any other place than

Expense Account Hotel Room
The suite your publisher's installed you in free of charge (within reason, as 
you've discovered trying to order adequate dinners from Room Service) till you 
get your goddamn book done.  Your deadline's three days away and you haven't 
written a solitary word.  Not word one;  zippo;  nada city.  Even if you could 
think of a word or (miracle of miracles) two you'd need to sober up massively 
before you could enter it into your laptop.

Oh, the room?  There's a bed that's been slept in way too often, unaltered by 
the housekeepers since your last nap.  There's a hotel chain's idea of a 
workdesk, a doorway into the bathroom at the southeast end of the room, a 
walk-in closet to the east, the door to the hallway in the northwest corner.  
Gillian your editor, bless her heart, instructed them to remove the t.v.  A 
minibar stands on the wall.

On the workdesk is a laptop connected to a printer (in which is an improbable 
supply of paper).

You also see a telephone.

The minibar supports a small coffeemaker.

Next to the coffeemaker are three packets of Insta-Drip Dark Roast.

Bedsit
Rachel's bedsit is small and sparsely furnished, but is certainly nicer than 
living at home with Mum and Dad.  Her boyfriend bought it six months ago, and 
although he hasn't given it to her, he's quite happy for her to treat it as her 
own.  It's just this one room with a tiny bathroom attached.  To go to work 
she'll need to go out, but not until she's dressed. 
In the room is her bed, desk and a bedside cabinet. 
A small wardrobe for her clothes is in the corner. 

There's a note pinned to the wall.
A photo hangs on one wall. 

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>You can't go in that direction, but you can move in.

>What does Rachel want to take?

[ "The word 'dignity' is not
  in a dog's vocabulary."
  
                 -- Garfield]

Dozing lazily in the morning sun in your little hut, something suddenly makes 
your ears go stiff. You scan the air, trying to figure out what it was. You 
stretch your paws, reluctantly wag your tail, and get up.
Vigorously shaking the dust off of your fur, you have a sudden insight: the 
perfect shape of a bone forms in your mind. Yeah, that's it! Somewhere, 
somehow, there must still be a bone left from last fall. If only you could 
remember where it was...

Your Hut
A thin beam of sunlight illuminates this shabby hut just enough to see what a 
mess it really is. Wood planks wildly nailed together, frozen drops of tar on 
the roof serve to show what dogs are worth to their masters nowadays.
A somewhat rectangular hole in the eastern wall leads outward.

Your good old friend Blamant the Teddy is here.

      -- The Toilet Encyclopedia, 1953     ]

You are finally at home. Those parties at Stifler's always drive your stomach 
mad. Drinks of all kind, kindly mixed by Slacks, the favourite barkeeper. With 
those drinks, it's always the same bad thing: At least 60% alcohol, rest either 
alcohol or some alcoholic beverage. Only food served: chips. chili chips. 
Lighting farts is one of your favourite hobbys at these events. But sometimes, 
some 'hardware' finally presses down your guts to reach fresh air. Then, always 
around four in the morning, it's time to go home. Luckily, your one room 
apartement isn't far away from stifler's, so you get here after about five 
minutes of fresh walking. As it is the fact with walking, it does a good job in 
driving the bowels down further...

Big Crowded Room (Your Home)
Your only place to hangout alone on this whole fucking world. Alas, as you 
aren't the clean type of man, the first thing that comes in view after entering 
here is the floor. Or, to be more precise, the things covering the floor. 
However, as they are mostly litter or far to messy to be of use ever again, you 
don't have to pay any attention at all to them.
You eye around the walls and get hold of the other ingredients for your thing 
called room:
A computer, sitting on a large oak wood desk in the back wall of the room, 
right next to a huge, dirty window. To the left, a bed with a once clean 
covering and a closet full of things which resembled clothes once upon a time. 
To your right, an oven tries to hide masses of roaches, while the old fridge 
next to it tries to keep it's door closed in spite of the enormous pressure 
resulting in at least four different chemical reactions taking place in there. 
Before the fridge, an old cupboard catches dust. This is your home, though, and 
it wouldn't be complete without a bathroom. So, to the south is the door 
leading to this holy place of mankind, while the door through which you walked 
in here is to the west.

Throne Room
Within the lavish throne room of Carentan's palace, there are multiple heavily 
armed and armored men-at-arms of the realm present. Great braziers atop 
man-high marble columns bathe the entire hall in warm oranges. Colored sunlight 
shines in through a sprawling stained glass illustration of the kingdom's 
borders. Along the floor stretches a plum-colored rug that goes from the main 
doors to the throne. Banners of the numerous lords and dukes of Carentan are 
displayed prominently on the sides of the throne room, yet are dwarfed by the 
massive curtain-shaped cloth depictions of the King's royal emblem.

A massive chestnut door lies slightly at the south end of the hall, revealing a 
lush courtyard.

King Girard sits upon the ivory and granite throne. As one of his most 
prominent knights, he has just now called you. King Girard rises from his 
throne easily, for he is still in his prime.

"Sir Louen de Galand, it is good you made haste arriving. Our realm, and 
possibly all realms of the living, is under threat."

It used to be said that there are two kinds of magic-user: those who have been 
to Tolti-Aph, and charlatans. It used to be generally understood that the 
attempt to prove oneself in the unforgiving society of Tolti-Aph was a bid for 
rapid level advancement or else romantic, thin-young-mage-in-midnight-black-
robes death. The closer you get to the wilderness island vaguely marked 
"Tholtaff" on the agate globe in your great-great-grandfather's study, the 
better the alternative sounds: settling down in some coastal village, perhaps, 
a little weathermongering, some polymancy, and helping out with the nets after 
a bad storm. Retire at maybe level 3, with most of your experience points 
gained from observing rare fish-based poisons carry off those villagers 
careless about gutting. Publish an awesomely tedious monograph on the correct 
usage of the "untangle rigging" spell. You know, the good life.

Longwall Street
Almost overgrown in the deep forest, collapsed and at once standing, the 
cyclopean east-west Longwall of the fallen city sinks here to a mostly flat, 
lichened stone clearing: it must once have been a customs post. To the west, an 
old wall turret like a broken chess piece still seems enterable by a dark 
doorway, whereas the eastern side of the wall's gap is only a shapeless ramp of 
masonry. Northwards, to what was once the interior, stubborn, wiry trees 
grapple with ancient pavings.

> I beg your pardon?

> That was a rhetorical question.

Fallen Tree
The overgrown ground, sloping gradually downwards to the north, is interrupted 
here by the fallen trunk of a giant of a tree. The trunk seems to have 
partially demolished an old town-house to northeast.

Propped against the trunk in a parody of a sitting man, a skeleton - no, a 
woman's, to judge from the pelvis - shines white in the sunlight. The empty 
eye-sockets look up at the sky with a curious sort of expectancy.

On the skeleton's lap is a leather pack.

SAMEGAME
Another episode in the Z-Machine abuse saga
Release 1 / Serial number 980731 / Inform v6.15
Standard interpreter 1.0

Z-Machine version  1998 Kevin Bracey (kbracey@acorn.co.uk)

Use cursor keys or the mouse to select a ball.
Remove that ball and its matching neighbours by pressing Enter.
Balls can only be removed if two or more neighbours match.
The more balls that are removed each turn, the higher the score.
A bonus of 500 points is awarded if all balls are removed.

[Press any key to begin]

Thank you for playing SameGame!

My inspiration came from Andrew Plotkin's Freefall and Torbjrn Andersson's Robots
.

SameGame is not my idea - I first saw it as Jon Read's version for the Psion 
Series 3a and Acorn PocketBook II, although it's been around much longer than 
that. You can get his version from http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~jnr95r
/psion/samegame.html.

SameGame is an extreme stress test of your interpreter's Standard compliance; 
it uses file access, the mouse, font 3, colour, the Unicode extension table and 
print_unicode, together with the rare opcodes print_table and log_shift, just 
to check your interpreter author is awake.

It should run okay on an interpreter conforming to version 0.2 of the Standard 
(except it will probably crash if you manually select display mode 4), and 
perfectly on an interpreter conforming to version 1.0.

object have been vouchsafed to knights of great purity and
prowess, but, so far, nobody has managed to bring the thing
back for the royal trophy case. It is up to you...
You are standing by the drawbridge in Castle Moan. A
cheering crowd urges you to go out to certain death on
a quest for the Sangraal, as have many knights before you.
The road leads out northwards over the drawbridge.

This file contains hints for Sangraal, a text adventure originally written for 
the Phoenix computer system at Cambridge University. Many of these games were 
later published commercially by Topologika, at which point they gained a 
built-in hints system. Sangraal was never published this way. The original 
version never had hints, nor does the ZCode conversion which is available at 
the IF Archive. This file intends to remedy that situation.
The hints are presented as a nested menu, more or less like Infocom's hints. 
They are arranged rougly by game area. As in the Topologika games, for some 
questions you will get a warning before a final, explicit hint is given. One 
Topologika feature which is missing in this file is the option to inquire after 
the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be found among the other 
questions.

One tip which may be useful in the game in general is that, if you walk into a 
room and don't know how to go back to where you were, Phoenix games include the 
unusual command "back". Be careful, though: this does not work in all 
circumstances. In particular, it is often made ineffective in mazes.

Sangraal was written by Jonathan R. Partington in 1987.
These hints were written by Richard Bos in 2014, using Inform 6.30.
Inform was written by Graham Nelson in 1993; version 6.30 in 2004.

Every Christmas it's been a joy to give presents to all the good little girls 
and boys. Hauling presents, climbing down chimneys: it's no easy job being the 
guy who lives to bring joy throughout the world on Christmas, but you, Santa, 
are up to the challenge. Now you've made almost all your gift-giving rounds, 
and the only thing between you and a good eleven months of well-deserved rest 
is the last house, the Madisons'. 

Before you land your sleigh, you double-check your gift list in your magic book 
to make sure you have all the Madisons' gifts: A Barbie for Kelly Madison, a 
Batman action figure for Justin Madison, a Wii for the whole family, a bone for 
their dog, Tina, and two bags full of candy and toys for the kids' stockings. 
Yep, that's everything! You park your sleigh on the Madisons' rooftop, and exit 
the sleigh.

Rooftop
Newly fallen snow sits gently on the roof. Nearby, you spot a chimney you can 
climb down.

Your sleigh sits nearby, right where you parked it.

Leading the sleigh is your trusty Reindeer Brigade, without which you couldn't 
make a single Christmas delivery.

The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've overexpended 
yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne, carriage rides in the 
Tuileries, having your name whispered behind manicured hands, getting elegant 
ladies out of elegant fixes -- and you're in debt. Bound by oath and honor to a 
pack of scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned you 
against their type.

You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask him for an 
advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a month or two. But 
according to the local population, the Count hasn't been home in months, and 
Marie, who was in residence until recently, has vanished as well. "No one 
around the big house now," says one of the peasant women tersely. "Even turned 
off the cook, they did." 

But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it, your 
creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the fields anyway, 
and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall. You will just have to 
find what you can.

Kitchen Garden
West is the wall of the kitchen. Most of the space along the wall is planted 
with herbs -- bay, parsley, stalks of mint -- left of the open doorway. To its 
right is only a drainage ditch, catching the outflow of a pipe that comes 
through the wall.

In one corner of the plot is the well, drilled many deep feet; in another is 
the antique sundial.

A tangle of climbing roses covers almost completely the wall and door of a shed 
to the southeast.

>I beg your pardon?

>But yes.

>You can only really go west, what with the roses covering the shed.

>(the roses)
The roses are equipped with really ferocious thorns.

 Credits

Graham Nelson and Andrew Plotkin have made many contributions to our world. 
Without Inform and "Lists and Lists" this game would not be. 

Larry Kwong tested "Informatory" and suggested it be made into an honest 
tutorial. This is the result. 

Jennifer Vaughan, Neil Cerutti, and Barbara Wood tested the game. They earned 
their many thanks.

 Notes

This game may not work at all on some versions of the Z-Machine since it relies 
on some obscure features that may not have been implemented or may have been 
improved away. See the appendix on Z-Machines in the Book of Inf. It does work 
on WinFrotz. If you get a crash when attempting to create or modify objects, 
try the split command as discussed near the end of Section 104 of the Book of 
Inf. 

All comments will be gratefully received. They should be sent to

[ This age thinks better of a gilded fool
  Than of a threadbare saint in wisdom's school.
   
                    - Thomas Dekker (1572-1632)]

You worked hard to get here. You studied late, saved the money from your part 
time jobs, and listened endlessly to your mother's hopes for you. She 
sacrificed to help you in your quest, and boy did she let you know it. Finally, 
the admission letter arrived. 

You have never really been away from home before, just trips to nearby towns 
for high school games. But now, two days of travel by coach train are over. The 
city is a new experience for you, strange and wonderful and busy. It is an old 
city, not large, and it wears its age with grace and pride. You make your way 
through the twisting streets, and at last you enter the campus. 

You won admission; you have the creased letter with you on this great day. This 
is your first day of school.

To get started, look at the admission letter in your possession.

Leafy Quadrangle
This pleasant, grassy quadrangle is shaded by magnificent trees. Peaceful, 
almost cloistered, it eases your nervous excitement with a sense of serenity 
and high purpose. It is everything you had imagined the campus of a renowned 
institution of higher learning would be. 

The entrance to the distinguished, ivy covered, administration building lies 
directly east, and there is an inviting path winding around the building to the 
southeast. The impressive archway of the campus gate stands to the west. Beyond 
the gate is the muted bustle of the city and its myriad attractions.

Homunculus' Realm
Your eyes take a moment to get used to the darkness that surrounds you, but you 
eventually manage to peer into the thick ink that presses in around you. 
There's a small dusty wooden area that serves as a floor, surrounded by dense 
black nothingness. Cluttered objects litter the floor, some falling apart, 
including a huge chipped marble head and a silent Grandfather clock.

You can see an ivy clad wooden panel, a statue's head, an upturned bookcase (on 
which are a large leather bound book about Time and a manuscript about 
Information), a wooden floor (on which are a digipad and Snow covered key), a 
large grandfather clock and a mysterious voice here.

Clearing
You are standing upon a barren patch of ground, surrounded by a sea of 
evergreen trees. Apart from the faint rustling of autumn leaves, the hearth 
seems largely noiseless. Slimmers of light stream in through the forest canopy, 
giving the world a blurry and dream-like quality. A warm breeze brushes against 
your exhausted body, granting you some much-needed warmth.

A bearded old man is seated on a large rock a few meters away from you, smiling 
devilishly. You contemplate questioning the cheerful onlooker, but for some 
reason, words just dont seem to come out of your mouth. The letters "TRISAN" 
are tattoed across the woodsman's left cheek. His name perhaps?

"Confusion clouds your mind, child", says the wizened old man, "But soon it 
shall all be clear." He chuckles in an sly fashion and then adds, "Go East, 
Son. Into the dim woods".

He points his scrawny finger towards the Eastern trees.

You feel a sudden urge to do his bidding and head Eastwards into the dark 
forests.

A giant falcon is seated upon the man's outstretched arm.

You can see Old Man and Falcon here.

Shallow
An Interactive Fiction by Austin Eady
Release 1 / Serial number 121109 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

A Bottomless Void
Deep inside the void, you hear a quiet sobbing that surges from a source that 
you can not locate. The wailing sounds are weak and broken, almost feminine, 
but not quite. It seems nearly familiar, yet distant, like the relationship of 
the sun and the moon. Your sight betrays you, for even though you stare into 
this absurd reality, your concentration mirrors this realm, never fixating, and 
always in motion. The weeping rises in intensity, the cries assault your ears 
more often, and they increase in volume. A variety of strange, swirling and 
altering colours converge around you, and then suddenly retract, and converge 
once more. A ceaseless kaleidoscope of glowing lights and shifting imagery. The 
lament of the woman induces an abrupt pain above your right eye, causing you to 
close your eyes and avoid the tornado of colour, but the scene remains there, 
unaffected by humanities natural hiding mechanism. You shake your head, trying 
to negate the invasive gaze of this indifferent scenery, but its hold never 
falters, and restrains you. The wails suddenly morph and alter into a 
distorted, masculine voice, and a strange gargling sound emits from deep within 
its throat.  The throaty sound drones on, staying at a rather low note, but the 
sound does not alter, or form into a comprehensible fragment of speech. It 
seems as if it is waiting for you to make the first move, but you have no idea 
where the sound's host is, as you can only hear the low, gargling noise.

 Though you can't find the source of the deep, throaty sound, you decide that 
it would be best to look around this strange, colourful and eriee realm.

This back bedroom looks as if a bunch of horny teenagers just drank beer, 
smoked pot, and made out with their girlfriends in here, which is probably the 
case. The room is scattered with Women's undergarments, beer cans, small 
puddles of vomit, cigarette butts, empty ziplock baggies and (ugh!) used 
condoms. The smell of spilled bong water pervades the air, making you wrinkle 
your nose in disgust. Doorways lead south, west, and east.

The bag of pot you bought from your dealer lies on the green and gold shag 
carpeting among a few burned matchsticks and some beer cans.

It's been a half a year since your commander woke you from hypersleep. Your 
ship is on a 50 year trip out to the newest colony. You're the second-to-last

You can hardly remember how long ago it was you first set out on your quest; it 
feels like months. Nor can you recall how long it's been since you last saw 
another human being; that feels like weeks. Your memories have become so 
jumbled you find it hard to recall any particular incident at all, but you 
reckon it's been nearly two days since the last of your food ran out, and at 
least three since you lost most of your equipment in a snow-slide, and now you 
are cold, hungry, and all but totally exhausted. It's only some grim mixture of 
habit, determination, and stubborn refusal just to lie down and die that keeps 
you plodding on mile after mile after mile. But now at last the mountain range 
is in sight, and there you know your quest will end.

Snowquest
A Curious Tale by Eric Eve
Release 2 / Serial number 100127 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Snow Plain
Snow is all around you, reducing everything in sight to a vast, white, 
featureless plain. You'd hardly be able to tell one direction from another were 
it not for the sun rapidly sinking towards the western horizon, and the 
mountains up ahead to the north. Unless you're much mistaken, those mountains 
mark the end of your quest, but you won't reach them tonight. Indeed, if you 
don't find shelter soon, you'll probably freeze.

For a moment, there seems to be something sparkling in the sky, but then it's 
gone.

>I beg your pardon?

>There's no one here to talk to.

>You trudge on for a while, until you find yourself ascending a track through 
the foothills.

Track Through Foothills
The track is knee-deep in snow. To the south the ground descends gently back 
towards the plain, while to the north it meanders towards the distant mountain. 
Just to the west is the mouth of a cave where you could take shelter for the 
night. Some distance above the mouth of the cave a small, leafless tree clings 
to the barren hillside.

The reddening sun is approaching its nightly death, having sunk level with the 
top of the hillside.

>(the thick clothes)
It's far too cold to even think of taking them off.

Hot, foul, and dark. How did indoor theater become so fashionable? Well enough 
in spring rain or winter, but not in the thick, dead afternoon of high summer. 
And though Rito and Imita looks very fine, shining with electric moonslight in 
the enclosed gloom, you're much more aware of being crammed in neck-by-neck 
with your sweaty fellow citizens.

Damn the crowd, in truth: your mood was hot, foul, and dark when you sat down. 
Aessa was supposed to meet you here. She's made excuses before, and you don't 
think about what it might mean. Try not to think, rather. Just watch the story. 
One of your favorites. But it's miserably hot, and you just aren't caught up in 
the play...

Lower Theater (on the bench)
If nothing else, you have a good seat. The stage is only a few rows to the 
north. People are jammed on benches in every direction; you think the aisle is 
somewhere to the west.

The play is into the final act. Rito has finally found out about Imita's 
affair, and he stalks the stage, whipping voice and hands about himself. A 
footfall behind him; he turns, and sees Imita. She backs a step at the force of 
his gaze.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

The players continue....

   Rito:
   How come you, harlot? Dare you come this way,
   your skin yet dark with Tato's shadow's stain?

   Imita:
   Young lord, I will not kneel. And shadowed dark,
   or white with rays of moon or sun or moon,
   my flesh is mine. Or nearly so; I find --

   Rito:
   Say on! What more has hated Tato done?

You shake your head, trying to net your straying thoughts, and catch a flash of 
copper hair. A few rows back, by the aisle -- Aessa couldn't have shown up and not
 seen you, could she? She wouldn't be avoiding you.

...into an old bed. A cloud of dust leaps into the air around you.

As sore as you are, you're pretty sure you're not injured, and when some of the 
dust settles you're able to get up and look around.

Unlike the rest of the house, this room seems untouched for the most part. The 
dresser and vanity are covered in dust; their drawers haven't been yanked out 
and tossed around the room. The door to the east is closed. The windows to the 
west are smashed, but the curtains are still hanging. It looks like the only 
thing that's been disturbed is the bed, and we know who to blame for that.

Probably the first thing you should do is type in "x me" and then hit Enter.

Welcome, agent number 3084.
Do you want to be told the details of your mission?
y
 You have been summoned to MI7 headquarters, popularly known as
'The Zoo' in order to unmask a mole. The chief of MI7, Sir
Arthur Cayley (known to his friends as 'Z') is extremely
worried, because the plans for the new Sonic Macrothrodule are
believed to have been leaked. They were kept in the safe in his
office, and were there yesterday when he came in at 9 a.m.; the
safe had been disturbed when he checked it this morning but the
plans were still there. Z reckons that it would take at least an
hour to remove the plans, copy them, and return them.

 With Cayley is Superintendent Hardy of Special Branch, who has
been assigned to MI7 on special duties for some weeks.

 "We're off for a drink in the 'Cloak and Dagger' now," says Z.
"Take a look round. Because of your unofficial position we can't
openly give you access to the files, but if I were you I'd start
with my secretary's office while she's downstairs -- she'll have
details of my movements yesterday, as well. You can probably
rule out Newton, who is abroad, and Brauer, who's on holiday.

 Nobody else knows you're in the building now that a new
Security guard has come on duty. The guard usually patrols at
about 7 p.m. Don't let anyone see you, or you'll have to abandon
the investigation. Come and find us if you think you have some
useful information. Good luck!"

 Cayley and Hardy are joined by a third person as they go down the stairs.

 Are you ready to start?
y
You are at the Southern end of the first-floor corridor, which
seems to be fairly brightly lit throughout: for security
purposes the lights seem to be fixed to be on at all times.
Three doors confront you at this point, each bearing the name of
their alleged occupants. To the south, the notice says "Sir
Arthur Cayley K.B.E. M.A. Head of Department." To the west, a
similar sign says "Miss Pell. Secretary." and to the east the
notice says "Russell. Accounts" There is further corridor to the
north, with several more closed doors leading off it.
> quit
Are you certain you want to quit?
y
You scored 5 points out of a maximum of about 270.
You have achieved the rating "Licensed to Breathe".

July, 1892.

Father is off to Oxford again, and Mother's gone with him.  You know what that 
means: another day in the care of Uncle Stephen, who is nice but boring, and 
Aunt Emma, who means well but won't let you do anything fun.  Worst of all, 
it's a Sunday, which means you're sitting very upright in Aunt Emma's parlour, 
in all your stiff-starched Sunday best, trying to read Uncle Stephen's latest 
sermon about one of the less-interesting parts of the Bible while Aunt Emma 
pretends that she wouldn't rather be knitting and Uncle Stephen hides under a 
pile of Hebrew and Latin and Greek in his study.

Plus, it's gloriously sunny outside, and you can smell the grass from in here.  
It's just not fair.  All the servants have the day off because Uncle Stephen 
and Aunt Emma don't believe in making people do any real work on Sundays, and 
you can bet that they -- Janet and Morris and Cookie, each of whom is loads 
more fun than Uncle Stephen and Aunt Emma put together -- are probably not all 
cooped up indoors in their Sunday best.

If only there were some way you could escape....

Parlour (in the armchair)
The parlour is Aunt Emma's domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and cosy on 
cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in the fireplace.  On 
warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly claustrophobic.

You are ensconced in an armchair near the fireplace.  Escape seems most likely 
either east into the hall or north into the dining room.

From her portrait above the fireplace mantel, Queen Victoria gazes benignly 
down on the room.

Aunt Emma sits by the window, dutifully reading her Bible.

Your horse went lame five miles back, so you had to leave him at some peasant's 
farm and continue the journey on foot. It would have been tempting to rest 
awhile, accepting the peasant's rustic hospitality, but the king's orders were 
explicit - make for Swineback Ridge with the minimum of delay. Weary though you 
are from battling against rebels in the east, the king insisted that he needs you
 here, to take command of the hopelessly outnumbered army up on the ridge 
ahead, an army that's your homeland's last, best hope to turn back the 
barbarian hordes and avoid the fall of night.

For the tenth time today you wonder about the urgency. The last you heard 
General Chorza was in command of the army up on the ridge, and you know Chorza 
of old, a fine soldier and a good commander. So what is it that Chorza cannot 
handle himself?

Dusty Path
The long dusty path leads through untended fields up towards Swineback Ridge to 
the north.  To the south it leads back into the heartlands of the Kingdom of 
Lorayne, the land you are determined to defend at all costs against the 
barbarian hordes of the Phartipu. A narrow lane leads off across the fields to 
the east. 

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n

Lower Ridge
The path from the south starts to climb the ridge where you expect to find your 
army encamped. Worryingly, there's no rear-guard here, no baggage-train, no 
sentinels posted to greet you. More worryingly, you hear no signs of life from 
up above, no singing, no orders being shouted, no clank of weapons on armour as 
troops move about.

What do you want to take?

Welcome to the official game of the classic film The Citizen of the Year! You 
must win the coveted Citizen of the Year award to beat your no-good neighbour 
Balser at his own game.

 Since graphics suck, you'll have to use your imagination to play! How 
exciting! I believe I just pissed all over myself in sheer glee!

You can see the classic film this game was based on here:

The Citizen of the Year: The Game
An Interactive Fiction by KG , inspired by the brickfilm made by Watson ( 
Players Unfamilier with The Citizen of the Year are encouraged to type About

Release 1 / Serial number 060908 / Inform 7 build 3V01 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/11N) 

Your Lawn
You exit your rundown shack to seize the day. Your frontyard is full of 
worthless crap, among them some umbrellas, a foam shark head, a pile of rifles, 
and a trashcan full of dead parrots. It's best not to ask.
 Your goody-two shoes neighbour Balser walks up to the fence to greet you. You 
cringe.

"Good Morning, neighbour!" chirps Balser.

"Oh, hello, Balser." you say with a strong sense of conviction.

"I've just got nominated for Citizen of the Year again!" said Balser.

"Again, eh? Congratulations." you lie.

"Well, the satisfaction of knowing I've helped others is all I need. If I don't 
win, I'm fine with that!"

"Same here!"

"Well, I better be going," said Balser, "Those soup kitchens don't run 
themselves!"
 And with that, Balser walks down the sidewalk, till he's out of sight. You let 
out a sigh of relief.

"I hate that Balser, he thinks he's so good!" you mumble under your breath. "I 
should win Citizen of the Year, just to beat him at his own game!" 
 To the west is your stupid neighbour Balser's mansion, and east leads to the 
city.

You can see a Shark Head and a Letter here.

   Your eyes are still closed. You feel weary, and dirty. Your mouth is filled 
with slime, as if you'd just drowned in some god-forsaken swamp

   You open your eyes. You're in a tent, and a man in a military uniform is 
standing above you, looking down angrily. You feel disoriented. You're not 
supposed to be here. It's dark, and ugly, and cold. You can hear the rain 
outside. This is no place for a man.                    
   But you're still here, always here - there is no way out until the war is 
won, and the war never ends. This is not a mistake. This is your life in hell.

On the whole, it was worth the trip. The plains really were broad and 
grain-gold, if scarred with fences and agricultural crawlers. The mountains 
were overwhelming. And however much of the capital city is crusted with squat 
brick and faceless concrete hulks, there are still flashes of its historic 
charm. You've seen spires above the streets -- tiny green parks below tenements 
-- hidden jewels of fountains beyond walls. Any bland alley can conceal 
balconies wrought into iron gardens, fiery mosaics, a tree or bed of flowers 
nurtured by who knows who.

This alley, however, is a total washout. It ends in flat bare dirty brick, and 
you've found nothing but a door which lacks even the courtesy of a handle. 
Maybe you should call it a day.

End of Alley
It's a narrow dead end here, with walls rising oppressively high in three 
directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash. (Your guidebook 
warned you: the police are as efficient about litter laws as about everything 
else they do.) You can retreat to the south.

A plain metal door faces you to the east, near the alley's end. It's firmly 
shut.

Taunting Donut
A super short Interactive Fiction by Kalev Tait
Release 1 / Serial number 080612 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

You wake to the gurgling of water. Like every other day. Your back is stiff 
from your hard bed. Not unusual either. At least "they" gave you a soft pillow. 
You open your eyes and spot todays meal. A donut. Tied with a piece of string 
to the ceiling. Completely out of your reach. It must be another test. Either 
that or "they're" just as bored as you are.

Your Room
Four walls. No doors. A soft light suffusing everything. You don't understand 
"their" technology, but you don't have to in order to live with it. If this 
could be called living. But you certainly sleep in it. Or rather, on the 
discomfort of your bed, made of various scraps of wood and bits of nails. A red 
hammer sits at the foot of your bed. Almost imedieately above your bed hangs a 
donut inexplicably tied to the ceiling. In one corner of the room gurgles a 
fountain (at least you think that that's what "they" were trying to make) while 
in another is a crowbar.

You trudge in from a long, hard day's work down at the box factory in what 
seems to be more of an exhausted crawl than a standard walking movement, eager 
to relax with a can of ass-cold extra-strength super-premium lightly carbonated 
beer (the type MEN once drank) and your favourite TV show. You take pride of 
place on the couch, take a deep relaxing breath, and then realise... the remote 
control has disappeared. You best try and find it so that this stressful day 
can be done with. (If this is your first time playing Interactive Fiction, type

Living Room
You stand in a boring, old, generic suburban living room. You notice that the 
wallpaper is cracked and there is an odour of mothballs and cat urine about. To 
the east is the kitchen. Outside is a driveway.

There is an old television here. Sparks are known to fly from the power cable 
on occasion.

There is a couch here. You don't trust the sticky fabric for a second.

A smoke detector is installed in the roof.

 Dear Blogreaders, 
 yesterday was the strangest day of my life! The things I have seen - and done 
- it was so strange...so horrible. And yet, wonderful. You remember that guy 
from the Psychology course? Paul? We had a date the day before yesterday. Some 
people already emailed me with questions regarding how it went. But sorry, 
especially to you, Toby43, but I was to tired, and, honestly, toO drunk to go 
online that night. I'll skip that part, maybe I'll write about it later, 
because I have to tell you what went down this night. Paul was throwing this 
big New-Years-Eve  party and he invited me (of course, I may add with what 
little self-esteem I have), to help him organize - and stay overnight.
 That's how it all started. I arrived in the midst of the party, because I was 
visiting my family before that. So when I went in the door, Paul rushed at me. 
I couldn't have anticipated what happened next, that this would turn into...

The Day I shot Hitler
An interactive Party by Taleslinger
Release 2 / Serial number 081206 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Paul, his brown hair in a cute pony-tail, rushes at you, a huge bowl of eggnog 
in his hand. He told you yesterday that he prepared it carefully after some old 
family recipe. He looks at you in utter horror, squeaking: "Mice."
"Of me to drop by?"
"No, Mice. They were in the house yesterday, and now one is in my eggnog." His 
voice is but a whisper.
"Hm, throw it away?" you suggest carefully.
"No, Alex, everyone is waiting for it. Also, the noodles haven't arrived yet 
and the sandwiches are disappearing rapidly.So people need something to feed 
on." 
Right at that moment, the head of a small mouse pokes out of the liquid. The 
little bugger looks around, then begins to swim around quite happily.
"Get rid of these foul vermin! Save my eggnog."
You both look down on the swimming mouse. "And please don't hurt the poor 
little creature." With that, Paul disappears into the living room, leaving the 
bowl in your hands.

hallway
A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of neon lights. Dark wooden stairs lead 
upwards, and a doorframe opens west into the Living Room. A small door under 
the stairs lead into a storage closet. (Referred to by Paul only as "The Potter 
Room".)
Your steps don't make any sound on the the thick, red carpet.

You can see a chest of drawers (closed) here.

You and your friend Pari have been digging out an escape tunnel. Yesterday she 
told you that it was ready and that she would come get you right after dinner. 
Unfortunately, it's already night and she's half an hour late, which is 
worrying you very much. Even worse, Nikhil probably isn't planning to leave for 
at least a few hours, and by then you doubt you'll have any chance.

Bedroom
The room is small, musky, and windowless. A single light bulb is hanging 
overhead, controlled by a light switch.  A bed is pushed in the corner, leaving 
only a little room for standing. The walls are made of solid gray concrete and 
are colored by various stains you'd rather not speak of. There is one hole in 
the wall for electricity. A wooden door separates this room from the hallway to 
the north.

On the bed is Nikhil Varma.

You can also see a plastic fan here.

be abbreviated "x", as in "x bed".)

Nikhil says, "Hey, what are you trying to do? I paid for this time, so stop 
wasting it."

If you want to leave, you'll probably have to be a little more surreptitious.

to change depending on what's in the room at the time.)

>(the plastic fan)
Taken.

(To talk to someone, just "mention" a subject while in the same room as someone 
else. This can be abbreviated "m", as in "m love". In addition, you can "think" 
in order to show a list of important possible subjects to mention.)

You've spent the best part of your life as a man dreaming of the goblet. Its 
history stretches back through the ages, featuring in one legend here, another 
there, and always as the centre of events. Those who behold it are cursed or 
blessed, for it is the beginning of their true lives, marking the end of the 
mundane, and the start of the fantastical.

And yet none have ever possessed it. Sometimes it is in the hands of a 
stranger, but such a stranger is not a person, only the means to an end, a 
courier of destiny.

You seek it. While you've had a job, a family, your thoughts were always

Entrance Room
Behind you is the entrance that you worked so hard to find. To the north, a 
craggy passageway leads into the distance, spotted with small pools of lava and 
cracks.

Here and there are decayed bits of foliage, and other assorted debris. In one 
corner, an animal seems to have made a nest of some kind.

You cautiously make your way north. You emerge from the shadows, and a gate 
crashes shut behind you. No way back. And all the supplies are with the horse.

Poetry Room
The walls here are made of stone, covered in runes. Most of them are 
meaningless to you, except for an inscription above the gate to the north.

A series of cushioned stools are placed in a semi-circle.

There is a clicking noise from the ceiling, followed by the sound of breathing.

"So, you're brave enough to face the fires and the shadows. But you can't turn

Santander, August 1940

You lie helpless on a filthy bed, naked, struggling against leather straps that 
bind you hand and foot.  Doctors and nurses surround you with looks that 
penetrate your body like knives.  One of them holds a syringe and smiles with 
an expression that is hostile and not entirely human.

"Now, Leonora, why won't you stop struggling and act like a lady?  This is for 
your own good, you know," he tells you as he sinks the needle into your arm.

Your body convulses and, still pierced by the doctor's hideous eyes, you find 
yourself falling into darkness.

is finally out of the labyrinth. The secret valley he seeks is now within

door, perched on one foot leaning up against the wall. He has a hand on the 
holster for his gun and the other with a lighter that he continuously flicks 
open and closed; flame then no flame. A roaring fire crackles behind you with a 
sudden hiss every once in a while. On the wall is a clock that makes a short

floor is a body, covered in blood with a bullet hole straight through his head.

                              The Colour of Magic

Movement across the Disc is perhaps noteworthy at this point. 

Unlike the usual fantasy environment, The Discworld does not have a north, 
south, east or west. Instead, and more suitably, there are two main directions: 
Hubward & Rimward. However, as the Disc itself revolves at the rate of once 
every 800 days, there are two lesser directions: Widdershins & Turnwise.

Rincewind sat at a little table in a dark corner of the Broken Drum. A fat and 
noisome candle spluttered above him, casting a dim glow across the alcove.
Moodily, he sat, nursing a mug of very small beer. It had cost him the last of 
his money and he was becoming more certain by the moment that it wasn't really 
worth it.

                              The Colour of Magic

Movement across the Disc is perhaps noteworthy at this point. 

Unlike the usual fantasy environment, The Discworld does not have a north, 
south, east or west. Instead, and more suitably, there are two main directions: 
Hubward & Rimward. However, as the Disc itself revolves at the rate of once 
every 800 days, there are two lesser directions: Widdershins & Turnwise.

The Broken Drum (Dark Corner)
Rincewind sat at a little table in a dark corner of the Broken Drum. A fat and 
noisome candle spluttered above him, casting a dim glow across the alcove.
Moodily, he sat, nursing a mug of very small beer. It had cost him the last of 
his money and he was becoming more certain by the moment that it wasn't really 
worth it.

>o
Sorry, that can't be corrected.

>n
Even the multi-lingual Rincewind didn't understand that!

>take
What do you want to take?

>quit
Are you sure you want to quit now? y

Thus, another epitomous escapade in the drama of the Discworld was ended.

Another attempt could not conceivably be made. Could it? 
Please answer yes or no.

As I woke up this morning, I felt something was amiss. The room seemed 
unusually large and I kept leaving my slippers behind. The toilet visit should 
have been telling, but it wasn't until I was in the middle of brushing my 
teeth, gazing idly into the bathroom mirror, that I suddenly realised.

I was a girl!

The Deva Loka is locked in a fierce battle with the mind-controlling Sirens.  

You are Lieutenant Commander Gruntik Hauror, though everyone just calls you 
"The Lion."  The captain and first mate are largely to blame: they never refer 
to you as anything but "The Lion," even when giving orders to others.  It's not 
an inaccurate nickname, as you are the only leonoid in a crew otherwise made 
entirely of canoids (and what a bunch of dogs they are).  Your nickname isn't 
even disrespectful--a massive lion a full head taller than anyone else aboard 
the ship commands respect regardless of rank.  Even so, you would appreciate 
hearing your rank once in a while. 

Now, though, was not the time.

You were bored one day, so you decided to take a walk. You wandered around the 
neighborhood for a few hours, taking in the sights and sounds, when you came 
upon a lone second empire style house on a hill. Curiously, you approached the 
house and noticed the door was unlocked. You entered the house and found 
yourself in a beautiful entryway. You hardly had any time to take in the 
experience when the door closed right behind you. You attempted to open it but 
you could not, it was stuck fast. A faint, sinister laughter echos softly 
through the depths of the house...

There is a flight of stairs leading up into a hallway, a doorway to the north, 
another doorway to the east, and a final one to the west. The front door, where

John was already on his phone by the time you glanced over your shoulder. He 
had forgotten the whole joke; he wouldn't have noticed if you just turned 
around and walked back. Which you really wanted to do, for some reason.

It felt like a pretty stupid thing to be afraid of.

You got up the nerve to walk past the last few headstones, but you kept your 
head down. You didn't even want to look at the feet. You just kept your eyes on 
the pedestal, on the exact spot where you finally set down the envelope, and 
then you turned around.

John was still talking to his phone, oblivious. You could feel it, though, like 
a finger lightly scraping up the back of your neck.

And then jabbing into your spine so you had to turn back around and look up at 
its face. And you thought (right away you told yourself the idea was 
ridiculous) that it nodded.

only as a conduit between the dining room (south) and the tunnel to the cellar

Of course, working in here is part of your job, so you and Chucky have a deal 
worked out. The deal is: You do not touch anything.

Right now is an exception, apparently.

"John wants you to take care of these," he squawks, thrusting a stack of cards 
toward you.

>That was a rhetorical question.

Threediopolis was the first city to have different sidewalk levels, one above 
another, back in 2050. It's pretty normal now in 2100, but they didn't plan 
everything right back then, so Threediopolis is still a bit quirky.

You still get lost some days, like today--while remembering a traumatic episode 
from your youth (adults yelling at you for somehow getting lost on a simple 
errand) you run across a building you've never seen. You enter and are whisked 
to a penthouse office. A fellow wearing a fractal power-tie and a white 
button-down shirt with elbow patches jumps up.

"Ah! You answered my online ad! What? No? You didn't? Even better! You're a 
natural! Unpoisoned by GPS! Just what I need! It's not anyone can find here. 
I'm Ed Dunn. You are? ..."

Before you can answer, Ed hands you a list of tasks, an equally mysterious 
package you're told not to open, and a pocket teleporter device, for getting 
back if you get even more lost than you need to.

"Getting here was the hard part, kid. Some places, like here, UncountableCo 
doesn't track. And if you don't get everything on this list done before you get 
back here, that's okay."

Before you can ask what list, Ed makes a hush-hush gesture. "It's organized by 
travel time, kid. Or it should be, once you find how to use it. Don't worry, 
just--don't lose it."

He explains how some things just don't need to be traced electronically, and 
how there's lots of weird scenery to see if you're interested in that sort of 
thing, and since you got here without knowing, you couldn't get anywhere on the 
list WITH knowing.

"Knowing what...?"

"One other thing, kid. You might want to use that teleporter pretty quickly if 
you don't see anything to start. Say, no further than five blocks. Til you get 
your bearings."

Ed stares at his computer, then snaps his fingers. "Oh, hey, I should push this 
button. Alphabetize this whole list, sort of. Make things easier for the 
rookie. What do you say?" [NOTE: if you haven't played before, I strongly 
recommend you take the hints by saying YES.]
"Got it. You look smart enough to take the extra challenge."

Pep talk time. "You got potential. You seem like someone who knows it's not 
just getting there, but HOW you get there." You've heard that truism 
before...but does it mean anything? You have no time to ask. Security whisks 
you away as Ed booms "And keep with it. Note what you found. Don't worry about 
the order, either!"

It's not a huge list. You even have addresses of where to go. It can't be too 
hard, can it?

OLD STONE BRIDGE
This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to the east,

the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an icy shadow over the bridge. There is 
no path to the CASTLE from here, but the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

The OLD STONE BRIDGE is guarded by a LIZARD MAIDEN, half a head taller than 
you. The LIZARD MEN rarely permit their women to become warriors, but this one 
obviously didn't seek permission! She may even be some kind of LIZARD-AMAZON 
hybrid ... you know not. She would be lovely, but for her green scales, cold 
blood, needle-like fangs and snake-like eyes.

She hefts an impressive green-metal TWO-HANDED SWORD and looks you in the eye. 
"I await a worthy foe, rat-slave. Dare you challenge me?" She laughs a hissing 
laugh. "If not, you may scurry away in peace. Only men of mettle concern me."

It is late afternoon, and the previously busy market place now has only a few 
stragglers trying to find last-minute bargains.
 Your stall is now devoid of all the home-grown delights that were piled on the 
table, and you are preparing to pack things away and return to your house.
It seems that Giles, next stall along, (for whom you have a secret fondness,) 
has also had a good day.  He stands, with the last remaining apple tree sapling 
that he has left for sale.
 You look shyly towards him, but all his attention is taken up gazing at Grace, 
the beautiful daughter of the local squire who approaches Giles' stall.

Hardly sparing a glance at the tree she throws some money at Giles' feet and 
instructs him to deliver it immediately to the Hall. 
 She sweeps away with a wiggle and a show of shapely leg below her silk gown, 
and Giles trots along obediently behind her like a faithful dog.

Voices of Spoon River

Every cemetery has a plot, a series of secrets that some would prefer stayed 
buried.

This graveyard is haunted. It wouldn't be, except that unresolved issues 
torment Spoon River's former inhabitants and prevent them from resting. 

Your mission is to set these issues right and release the suffering dead. Read 
the epitaphs, talk to ghosts, explore the town and examine objects till you 
find needed clues. 

Good luck! The eternal peace of several souls depends on your determination.

Near a fountain
It seems a bit odd to see a large fountain in the middle of the cemetery, but 
here it stands.  There is a statue of a man in the middle of the fountain, and 
it looks like people toss coins in the water for good luck. Gravesites are to 
the north, south, east, and west.

You can't help but notice that among the pennies and nickels in the fountain 
lies an iron key.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

Gravesite

You are in the middle of the cemetery.  At your feet is a grey headstone, 
weathered and crumbling with age. More plots are to the north, east, and west. 
The fountain is south.

>(the grass off)
That's hardly portable.

So, it's finally time again for the long awaited skiing holiday at your cabin 
in the Black Forest in Germany. You have worked hard the last few months at the 
office in Canberra and you don't mind leaving Australia for a while.

Yesterday, you arrived in Germany and met up with your friend who lends you a 
car whenever you are here. The flight was terrible and the food worse. You have 
promised your wife and daughters that you'll try to change the return ticket to 
another airline. However, as you wake up the first morning at the cabin, you 
find that your family is gone...

Bedroom
You are in your bedroom. Most of the floor space is taken by a rather large 
double bed. Against the wall is a small table, in front of which is a chair. In 
one corner of the room is a large closet. A door leads southwest.

On the table is a make-up bag.

You hear something quickly approaching! A roar is heard and the furniture 
starts shaking as something passes over the cabin. It could be a jet fighter 
whose altitude is far too low for comfort.

So now here you are, up in your office.  I am sorry that today is a Saturday.  
I am especially sorry that today is your thirtieth birthday.  We had all kinds 
of adventures planned.  I refuse to feel guilty.

Of course I am still upset.  I will try to set that aside and be encouraging.  
I really do want you to succeed today.

Please just write.

Hi, I'm your computer! Without me you can't play! There are a few things I 
would like to inform you, as this game is technically a little different. So do 
read!

It is because of MY great kindness that I included the command "use", which you 
should be very grateful for! The help menu, however, is not to be frequented, 
and is only for those who are at the brink of giving up. I noticed that the 
points updating system slows the computer a bit. So, it is off on default, and 
WOW, the computer works like magic! You can, of course, turn the score updating 
on with "score update on". Naturally, you would get tired of waiting, and would 
want to turn it back off with "score update off"!

The greatest hint in this game is to READ EVERYTHING! In fact, examining will 
be of so much help to you, I will even give you points for doing so! Talking 
about points, this game has objectives and achievements, which will also give 
you points! Lots of points!!! To view them, you can use "achievements"! There 
are also some useful information under "statistics"! As a matter of fact, you 
need not know all these, as I am about to give you the WALKTHROUGH! First, you 
must...

What? You want to start the game already? You don't want my advice? Hey, I 
could spoil the whole game for you! I can let you win! Ah well, here it is, 
then...

Virtuality
An Interactive Fiction by Mark
Release 1 / Serial number 100131 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Grassy Field
It is a warm day. You are in a beautiful grassy field that seems to extend 
forever in all directions. A cool breeze refreshes you. Flowers decorate the 
place with bright shades of pink, blue and yellow. You feel relaxed and happy.

Grassy Field
It is a warm day. You are in a beautiful grassy field that seems to extend 
forever in all directions. A cool breeze refreshes you. Flowers decorate the 
place with bright shades of pink, blue and yellow. You feel relaxed and happy.

>(the coin)
You already have that.

Computer Room
"That's all you paid for," says Bobby, throwing you out of the Virtual Reality 
machine, "You can't expect luxury to last forever!"

For some unknown reason, you had been captured and walled into this room with 
this stupid Bobby. You had been spending the past few hours in that Virtual 
Reality machine, experiencing paradise like it never was. But now, you are down 
to your last penny, and you have finally come to realise that it's about time 
you escape. Nevertheless, you are still tempted to spend your last penny for a 
final minute of luxury.

You are in a small room with no doors, no windows and no easy means of escape. 
The only things here of significance are a table, a computer set, a cardboard 
box and Bobby, a high tech talking machine that keeps bugging you with a 
strangely persuasive voice to try out its Virtual Reality machine (VR).

Bobby is a machine with advanced AI and can talk. However, it seems only to be 
able to talk about its Virtual Reality machine. Whoever put you in this room 
must have put Bobby there to torture you.

You have never before seen a Virtual Reality machine. And now that you have 
seen it, you love it. It is sadly ultimately controlled by Bobby, who demands 
payment for you to use it.

The computer is really old and rusty. But at least it's free for use.

A monitor is stuck to the wall. It is free for use too.

A keyboard is stuck to the monitor in some futuristic fashion.

For your convenience, and your convenience only, there is a chair where you can 
sit in a relaxed position while using the computer. My, you would never be able 
to use the computer without the chair!

The table is at the other side of the room, away from all the technology. On it 
are a manual and a glass.

The cardboard box is a box made of cardboard (obviously). You feel a magical 
force coming from inside the cardboard box, which is lying on its side and is 
big enough for you to walk into. It is closed.

Come to think about it, the dustbin might also be of significance. It always is 
in escape games.

"Just give it a try, it won't hurt you..." says Bobby, motioning you towards 
the Virtual Reality machine.

a short escalator, and then, the image
of the aforementioned man producing
various items from a steaming briefcase,
a 30 ft. deep well, and seven useless
objects carried by an old and wise-
looking, yet oddly inane man. The images
are blurred, as if viewed through a veil
of some sort (probably silk). These
images give way for another set of
images: of you doing your homework,
jogging in the forest, washing the car,
pruning the fruit trees, involved in
activities including the opposite sex...
in short everything you could have been
doing if you weren't playing this game.

This is a classic BASIC adventure from Creating Adventure Games On Your 
Computer, by Tim Hartnell, published in 1983.  It is a mostly direct 
translation to Inform with a few odds and ends added.  In being a translation 
of an older BASIC game, many of the descriptions are terse due to lack of RAM 
in those old dinosaurs.  This was my first attempt at an Inform game and I 
learned the language while doing this game.  As such, many things may have been 
done a little better, but the game is fully playable and, I hope, a small 
salute to Tim Hartnell for making such a great hobby book in the age of 8-bit!

"Excuse me. You in the fedora," says a female voice, behind you. "Excuse me, is 
it really too difficult to keep your dog leashed?"

"Yes," you say, turning. "I haven't got a dog."

The source of the aggravation is ten feet back on the path: hair between brown 
and honey, a Marilyn figure, and one of those tipped-up noses that makes a girl 
look always just a little annoyed.

There is also a short yellow animal worrying at her skirt.

"Whatever you call it, it obviously shouldn't be out unleashed."

"It isn't mine, and I don't know what it is." You and the girl look at the 
creature again. In the fading twilight of Central Park, it's hard to see 
clearly, but you're more than ever certain that it does not belong to the genus canis
.

An Interactive Afternoon by Ryan Veeder
Release 1 / Serial number 130429 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Bike rack
The coordinates you have are incomplete. They only narrow it down to this 
general area. And, although it's not a big park, the thing you're looking for 
is very small. Probably.

Between the train tracks and the softball field there's barely any room for a 
trail, and the bike rack here is almost lost in the overgrowth. Presumably 
somebody will come by at some point and prune the bushes, but today you're the 
only one around.

The trail leads south from here.

You finish locking up your bike and shove the key in your pocket.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>You'll probably head north when you bike back home, but for now your business 
lies south.

>(the bike rack)
Moving this bike rack is not currently possible.

Welcome to Adventure!

Xeno
An adventure game by Jonathan Mestel (Cambridge University, 1989)
[This translation: version 1.111115 / Phoenix v1.04 / Inform v6.32
Please type "inform" for further details.]

XENOPHOBIA Version 3.7

This is the fourth released version, so should be relatively bug-free.
Please type PLEASE. If you are new to this type of game type HELP.
Should I describe your predicament?
y

You wake up slowly with a frightful headache to vaguely familiar
surroundings. There is a loud and curiously soothing swishing noise in
your ear. After a while you realise that you are on a train, and that
the noise you can hear is your watch as you prop up your head. You are
lying on an entire seat and feel lousy.
Slowly you sit up and look around you. As you do so, someone badtemperedly
occupies the half of the seat you just vacated. You can remember next to 
nothing
about yourself and how you came to be where you are. It is a disturbing 
feeling.
There are various people around, but most of them are showing a deliberate
lack of interest in you. I imagine you are an unattractive sight.
You are in a railway carriage at the end furthest from the destination
of the train. The main passageway continues through a black, rickety
connecting tunnel into another carriage.
You are facing the same way as the train.
There is a copper-coloured Yale key here.
> quit
Are you sure you want to quit?
y
You've scored 32 points out of about 300.
Do you want another game?

See you anon.

This file contains hints for Xenophobia, a text adventure originally written 
for the Phoenix computer system at Cambridge University. Many of these games 
were later published commercially by Topologika, at which point they gained a 
built-in hints system. Xenophobia was never published this way. The original 
version never had hints, nor does the ZCode conversion which is available at 
the IF Archive. This file intends to remedy that situation.
The hints are presented as a nested menu, more or less like Infocom's hints. 
They are arranged roughly by game area. As in the Topologika games, for some 
questions you will get a warning before a final, explicit hint is given. One 
Topologika feature which is missing in this file is the option to inquire after 
the use of an object. Where necessary, these can be found among the other 
questions.

Before reading any hints, it might be helpful to get acquainted with some 
unusual features of Xenophobia that aren't shared by most other text 
adventures. Note that Xeno is unusual even for a Phoenix game. First, as in 
most Phoenix games, turning objects on and off is done using just the commands 
"on" and "off". This applies to switches as well as to lamps and suchlike. 
Walking around in the dark is safe, by the way.
Second, if you've played other Phoenix games you may be familiar with the 
command "back", which would usually take you back to the room you just left. 
This doesn't quite work that way in Xenophobia. For much of the game, you will 
be walking around compassless, and have to navigate using "left", "right", 
"forward" and, yes, "back". The result of "back" in Xenophobia is therefore 
similar, but not quite identical, to its use in other Phoenix games.
Finally, Xenophobia is a game which attempts to be realistic, and although in 
many ways "magical realistic" might be a more accurate description, if you find 
yourself faced with a problem you could face in the real world, applying a 
real-world solution, even if it doesn't comply with normal adventure game 
logic, is often a good idea.

Xenophobia was written by Jonathan Mestel in 1989.
These hints were written by Richard Bos in 2014, using Inform 6.30.
Inform was written by Graham Nelson in 1993; version 6.30 in 2004.

It seemed suspiciously generous of Drew to invite you to his burrow for lunch. 
It seemed too good to be true when you entered his quarters and saw a simmering 
stewpot in the center of the room. 

But not to worry! There's nothing in the pot but a thin broth, there's no 
proper food anywhere in sight, and Drew is still the no-account mooch that he's 
always been. 

As reassuring as all this is, though, you're still pretty hungry.

You've Got A Stew Going!
An Interactive Fiction in one act by Ryan Veeder
Release 3 / Serial number 150410 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

Drew's Burrow
As of right now you are in Drew's hole, a cozy (and murky and grimy) dead end 
in the tunnels' residential neighborhood. This is where Drew does his stuff and 
generally hangs out. Vague piles of junk lurk in the corners. The ceiling roils 
with a cloud of thin smoke, which spills out of the room through the doorway to 
the south.

Drew is here, lounging on a beanbag. "Let's get this stew on the road!" he 
cries, without getting up.

In the center of the room, over a small fire, sits a stewpot.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>If you want to dig a new route, you're going to need to get approval from the

"It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand 
Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We 
have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, 
never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is 
Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun 
and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. 
Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, 
long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, 
"take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a 
brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use 
whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses 
briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own 
question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out 
of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the 
newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a 
rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In 
the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic 
blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven 
glow.

You're always kicking yourself that you gave away the Dungeon Master gig all 
those centuries ago.  That outrageous treasury would come in handy in this 
nasty economy.  Instead you've piddled your immortal time away in a train of 
boring menial work, and here you are back in the GUE yet again, carrying that 
obnoxious brass lantern, on a heroic quest for ... fast food.

It's enough to make you hurl yourself off the parapet at your former workplace.

West Of Chasm
You are standing at the edge of a deep uncrossable chasm with no memory 
whatsoever of how you got here, although the number 68 springs to mind for some 
reason.  A not-especially-dark passage leads southwest and a grisly hole in the 
floor gives you the distinct feeling of being a one-way trip (one of those "you 
won't be able to get back up" situations).

Vault
This chamber is made of black stone.  The walls are pocked with age; showing 
faded frescos, the subject of which can no longer be determined.  The only exit 
is west, into a long. sloping tunnel that eventually leads back outside.  The 
weight of stone presses upon you, and you feel you must be deep underground.

AAS Masters

You have been summoned...called forth -- perhaps in a dream, perhaps in waking 
life different from the normality you inhabit usually. You are here at the 
behest of the AAS Masters. And either they will die or you will never ever 
leave....

Be sure to try smelling in all the rooms!

Blasted Heath
Though you do not know how you came to be on this empty heath, wind whistling 
around and almost through you, you do know the purpose of your appearance: You 
must track down and brutally slaughter the AAS Masters! From this heath, all 
directions are accessible to you.

You can see: nothing!

Windswept Plain
Not as blasted as the Blasted Heath, but the wind is here nonetheless. If only this plain had features, but alas, its featurelessness sucks the very marrow from the bones of your soul.

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To 
the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with 
an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise 
several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In 
the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west 
wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of 
sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in 
the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis 
court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively 
large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled 
among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green. 
 Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like 
a relic from the 1930s.

The bridge, usually bustling with orderly activity, stands eerily empty. There 
are no officers giving orders, no cadets trying to please, just the empty shell 
of the Command Carrier adrift in deep space, crewless, except for you.

Main Bridge
As the Grand Commander of the Xulthe'en Armada you have grown accustomed to 
your place on the Main Bridge, in the eye of the storm, not to this awful 
silence. If it wasn't for the fact that lights are still blinking on the 
consoles and the monitors are still displaying status information, you'd swear 
the ship was dead in space... 

Suddenly, a terrific impact on the ship's port side sends you staggering. 
You're still trying to get your bearings when you hear the ringing sound of 
metal-clad boots from below. A moment later, your worst fears are realized as a 
group of space pirates swarms up the ladder to the bridge. They clearly want 
the ship, and they've never been known to leave a man alive.

>That was a rhetorical question.

You stand there doing nothing as the pirates take over your Command Carrier. 
They show you no mercy, but at least it's over quickly.

...and then you wake up in a cold sweat, slowly realizing that it was just your 
own private nightmare.

Your Berth (on the bunk)
Your berth is small and cramped, especially with the curtains closed. The space 
is little bigger than a coffin; life aboard this deep-space transport has 
little use for unnecessary luxury. Above you, the wall-mounted light is off, 
leaving the compartment dim, though not peaceful; the "blip, blip, blip" of 
your alarm is ringing insistently.

This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper is 
peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and there. There

out back. Then, drop off all the debris - er, I mean, um, treasures - right

continues to drive your heart to the dangers and perils that spawn from 
adventure, and wearing buttons.

[ The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind
  is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind
  of fear is fear of the unknown.
  
  -- H.P. Lovecraft]

November, 1997.

You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the 
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter 
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to 
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming 
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was 
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and 
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping 
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a 
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move 
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even 
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and 
none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting 
to rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to 
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick 
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of 
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few 
minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of 
settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder 
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be 
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your 
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...[                 * THE FIRST DAY *
  
  I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern
  sea was upon me.

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle 
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of 
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and 
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's 
office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of 
town to the west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

>The street goes west from here. You can enter the office to the east or the

"Oh, nothing so difficult as that. I'll be at the exit of this linear maze. The 
end is only three moves away on a straight line, and then one more move to get 
out." 

Oh my god a maze. Run screaming! You haven't confronted a maze since the one 
that killed your parents in Belize... 

But this is Significant Other. For this, for this... no matter what the cost. 
"What's a linear maze?" 

"It's laid out in a strict, simple, gridlike fashion, and all the routes are 
reversible." 

"It doesn't sound so bad." 

"Mmhmm. See you soon, my love. Mwa ha ha."

Seabase Delta on my Amstrad CPC in about 1986. After that, I graduated to Level 
9 (Lords of Time is still a favourite) and then on to Infocom (HHGG, I will 
always remember you). I even tried to write my own adventure, in BASIC, but 
never got past about the third room. After that, education got in the way for a 
while, until I decided to strike out on my own last year. Now, I mix a bit of 
web design with a bit of independent research into quantum physics; not an 
obvious combination, I know, but it suits me. (If you want a website about

Dorm A
This is a very long room, lined with multi-tiered bunks. Flimsy partitions 
between the tiers may provide a modicum of privacy. These spartan living 
quarters could house hundreds, many of whom are sleeping here right now. There 
are archways on the north and east walls.

Visible exits: north (to the Long Hall and most of ifMUD), east (to the 
auditorium), south (to the Edifice Towers)

Wait ...

the whole atmosphere of the MUD has changed subtly. It seems somehow more 
serious, more urgent, more real ...

This room is brilliantly lit from all directions. In fact, it is unclear where 
the walls and ceiling end. A doorway leads to the west, and tunnels lead in

Visible exits: south (to Dorm A), west (to the Adventurer's Lounge), southwest 
(to the Big Dig)

It's Christmas Eve. Rather late on Christmas Eve.

Just this afternoon your darling 7-year-old daughter Samantha announced that 
fully a week ago she mailed a letter to Santa Claus asking for Sugar Toes 
Ballerina, the unbelievably sought-after, impossible-to-find fad doll of the 
decade. Unwilling to see little Sam heartbroken on Christmas morning, you 
frantically phoned every toy store in town. Miraculously, you found a shop that 
claimed to have a Sugar Toes Ballerina in stock!

But that was two hours ago -- before the flat tire. Now it's getting dark, and 
icy weather is closing in. The address you were given, on the outskirts of 
town, has proven to be that of a dilapidated and disreputable-looking shopping 
center -- not a modern chrome-and-neon strip mall, either, but a hulking 
two-story structure that looks to be the ill-favored offspring of a fairy 
castle and a canning factory. The shopping center is tucked well back from the 
street among brooding skeletal trees. Other than a few dim yellowish lights 
that show no trace of holiday spirit, the building is shrouded in gloom, and 
yours is the only car in the parking lot.

The Parking Lot
Except for your car and the dirty snowdrifts in the corners, this broad expanse 
of pavement is entirely empty. The wind whistles a little, and instinctively 
you hunch your shoulders and turn up your collar. The dark bulk of the shopping 
center squats in decaying splendor to the south, and a paved walkway leads in 
that direction.

[Note: For full instructions on how to play the game, type 'help' at any time.]

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>You stroll out and stand in the street for a minute. There's not a single car 
to be seen in either direction. Shortly you give up on this fruitless excursion 
and wander back into the parking lot.

>Sorry, gamers -- for both technical and philosophical reasons, in "Not Just an 
Ordinary Ballerina" the words 'all' and 'everything' can't be used for picking 
things up. You can 'drop all' or 'put all in X' if you need to, and you can 
pick up several items at once by listing them, like this: 'get X and Y and Z'.

  Heads fly and body parts soar through the air as you swing your mighty sword 
at the horde of evil barbarians. One by one, the minions of the evil overlord 
Kroz persishes from the wrath of your unforgiving blade. As the last of them 
collapse in a bloody heap at your feat. You raise your arms and shout out in 
victory. Princess Zomar rushes up to your side and caresses your bulging 
pectorals.
  "Thank you, mighty one, for rescuing me from a fate worse than death," she 
says in a breathy voice.
  "Say no more," you respond. "It was not just my duty. It was my privilege."
  "You are wounded," she gasps as she sees the cuts along your rippling biceps. 
"I must annoint them with various balms and ointments. I need to gather the 
magic healing lotion and rub it ever so thoroughly all over your body. But 
first, I must dress the wounds. Please forgive me, for I have nothing to dress 
them with apart from my sheer silk nightgown."
  With that, she starts ripping off large shreds of her gown and gingerly wraps 
them around the wounds, taking time to slide her hands over your body. She 
leans towards you ear, brushing her large billowy breasts against your 
shoulder, and whispers, "BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP"

You blink your eyes as the blaring alarm jars you into waking reality. You come 
to the sad realization that it was all a dream. The well-endowed Priness Zomar 
ceases to be and your bulging pecs have been replaced by the reality that is 
your huge beer gut.

Your bedroom is a nicely orchestrated mess. Clothes and furniture are strewn 
about in an almost artistic fashion. Salividor Dali would proud, if you had any 
idea who he was. Right next to the unmade bed is a tiny, wooden dresser. The

No doors, no windows, no exits.
The room is lit, even if there are no light sources...
Another buzz, in front of me...
In the northern wall there's now an open passage leading to another room.
Where am I?

Prologue
In which you discover some weird things and are likely to be dazed.
 . . . 

A grey, bare room
No windows, no doors, no objects on the floor, nor on the ceiling; no exits. 
The walls are bare. There's only an open passage in the northern wall, from 
which I can hear voices.

"Hello, kiddies, welcome to the first ADDition of TALES FROM THE COLLEGE. I'm 
your host Mr. Worse, Dean of PERMANENT student residence. Since this is my 
FIRST-YEAR show, I wanted to show you a DOUBLE ROOM but I had trouble selecting 
a roommate. I couldn't DIFFERENTIATE between them. So, tonight I've decided to 
introduce you to Kevin Johnson. But unfortunately he's been experiencing a

BREATH OF FRESH BLAIR!"

*SNAP* That was the sound of your last nerve cracking. You've lived here in 
Blair Hall too long. The neglectful RA, the screams at night, the fights in the 
halls and the vomit in the bathroom. You've tolerated it all until now. But now 
the sight of the broken dryer has caused the very last ounce of tolerance you 
had to come smashing down. You mind has performed a complete register dump of 
it's ability to think rationally. You are experiencing a BINARY BREAKDOWN!

"Twenty-three dollars," he's saying. "Twenty-three dollars for the best dream 
of your life."

You don't know his name or anything -- he's just the guy you always meet at 
parties thrown by people you've never met. He's nobody's friend, exactly, but 
everyone knows who he is when it's time. Probably doesn't even have a name, 
probably has bagged groceries at some godforsaken Shopper's Food Warehouse 
since high school, but who cares? He's here to help you in your hour of need.

"What do you say?" he asks, holding up a repurposed cough syrup bottle with 
something green inside. Green like candy almost never is.

Stuck in an Attic
Sure, you're used to piece-of-shit architecture (you live in Dundalk, for 
crissake), but this place will be receiving some kind of award from you by the 
end of the night. There's totally unimportant crap strewn all over the place -- 
old sewing machines, an Easy-Bake oven, even a set of folding chairs painted 
carnival blue -- but fortunately, almost all of it is in shadow thanks to an 
underperforming fifty-watt bulb directly above.

It's just you and the dude here. The only place in the entire house you could 
get any privacy. It's only ten o'clock and already the call to hook up has come 
down from the heavens.

Stairs lead downward, back to the party and that awful trance-bop they keep 
playing.

>
Hunh?

>no
Now technically speaking, you have a great deal of free will during this story, 
so you're allowed to call it a night here and now.

You can go ahead and go downstairs if you want to -- surely there's something 
interesting going on in this party. Maybe there's a pretty girl with long 
blonde hair you bump into and end up hooking up with. You won't remember 
whether her name is Alice or Alicia, so you'll bail the next morning without a 
word.

It's okay. You won't see her ever again. And it all happens again the next 
weekend, and the weekend after that, too.

So it's okay if you want to say no to the whole thing.

There's nowhere to go from here but down.

As the security guard waves you through, you linger for a moment to absorb the 
historic nostalgia of your surroundings... 

Paramount Studios. 

You can almost feel the ghosts of Gary Cooper and Cecil B. Demille brush past 
as you clutch your knapsack close to your heart. Inside the tattered little 
sack is the culmination of two years work: a seven part mini-series you've 
written on the life of former vice-President Walter Mondale, entitled Fritz, We 
Hardly Knew Ye. Beaming with pride since the completion of your epic, you've 
had your sales pitch memorized and well-honed for weeks now; certain of success 
once you finagled an appointment with that legendary television producer, 
Irving M. Sowritch. A quick glance at your appointment slip affirms your timing 
is perfect. In a few minutes you'll have him eating out of your hand.

An avid devotee of film history, you've read a great deal about this grand old 
piece of real estate. You feel as if you know it well. Looking around, you 
begin to imagine which of these historical offices you'll soon be calling your 
own. But you quickly shake off the seductive daydream, intent on remembering 
the security guard's directions: northeast to the Administration building, then 
straight ahead until you're outside Sowritch's office.

Melrose Gate
This is the grand entrance to the studio lot. For almost a hundred years the 
famous arches to the south have been the portal beneath which Hollywood's 
greatest stars have passed on their way to silver screen immortality. A 
pleasant walkway heads west, while the studio's main administration building 
can be seen off to the northeast.

It's a clear summer night in London.  You walk purposefully down Langley Street 
in Covent Garden looking for the pub.  It's nearly time and you can't be late.  
Tonight is the most important night of your life.  Ah! Here's the pub! You 
enter and walk directly to the bar, weaving in and around throngs of patrons 
happy to be enjoying a drink after a day's work.  You approach the bartender 
and inquire. You were told to speak to Nigel.  The bartender confirms he is 
Nigel and he asks your business.  You give him the reply just as you were told. 
 He nods his head solemnly and asks you to follow him.

He leads you to a door towards the back of the bustling pub. He gives the door 
two sharp knocks, pauses for three seconds then two more sharp knocks.  A regal 
voice from behind the door simply says "Enter!".  With that, Nigel hurriedly 
backs away and turns tail to resume simpler, safer duties tending bar.  You 
enter the room dutifully and close the door behind you.  Looking around you are 
deeply impressed with the furnishings.  Lots of red cloth, leather couches and 
recliners, the heavy smoke of cigars and the presence of just three men.  You 
know you are in the presence of true masters of their craft.  One of the men 
you recognize as your mentor, Simon.  The other two gentlemen you haven't met 
before.

The youngest man, perhaps 25 years old at best, rises and looks you over.  "I 
am the Grand Bastard." He has an unmistakable British accent. "Who sponsors 
this apprentice bastard?", indicating you. Your mentor rises and claims 
responsbility for the sponsorship. "Very well, let the trials begin.  I shall 
go first."

"An utterly clueless network user calls and asks you why the network is running 
so slow.  What is your response?"

"I cheerfully volunteer to immediately inspect the co-worker's computer, 
diagnose the problem and repair it." With this, you can see the Grand Bastard 
is greatly offended.  Undaunted, you continue..." I get under their desk, open 
the computer case and swap out the 100 megabit network card and replace it with 
a 300 baud modem with the speaker disabled.  I close the computer cover, plug 
the modem into a phone line, boot up the computer and make lightning-fast 
configuration changes the user can't follow.  When I'm all done their 100 
megabit per second connection is reduced to a 300 bit per second connection via 
demand-dial connectivity.  Without a doubt, they will never call me and 
complain again."

You wait breathlessly for the reaction of The Grand Bastard.  "That is an 
excellent solution.  You have passed my trial." Looking around at his two peers 
he continues, "Indeed, your response is so thorough, so diabolical and so 
effective I think we can dispense with the remaining trials.  Are we agreed?" 
Your mentor and the other BOFH both nod their assent.

"Then it is done.  I confer upon thee the formal title of Bastard Operator from 
Hell.  Return to the United States of America and do us proud.  Now.  Go! Begin 
thy tenure!"

Mission Control
Your office, where you carry out your Bastardly duties, is equipped with the 
finest furnishings and equipment necessary to perform your work.  As you have 
an aversion to cheap kit, your desk is the finest example of office furniture 
ever bestowed upon the human race.  Sitting atop this monument to furniture is 
the single most powerful computer in the company; your personal workstation.  
Only two decorations adorn the walls; a Bill Gatus of Borg poster and a daily 
calendar.  North leads out of Mission Control to other, less important areas 
while you spot a very large and serious looking door down the hall just east.

On the desk are an inbox (in which is a note from your boss) and an outbox 
(which is empty).

You can see an Armageddon-proof safe (which is closed) and Dave's Toshiba 
laptop here.

Book and Volume
by Nick Montfort

Release 8, 2005-12-25
Written in Inform 6.30 with library 6/11 

I greatly appreciate the help I've received from the interactive fiction 
community (particularly those who have discussed IF with me on ifMUD), the 
broader electronic literature community, and my literary collaborators. Thanks 
to all the authors, players, poets, reviewers, and others who have led me to 
think about writing, computing, and interactive fiction in new ways.

Book and Volume was written in Inform, a language for IF development created by 
Graham Nelson. It runs on the Z-Machine, a software computer developed by Joel 
Berez and Marc Blank.

I particularly want to thank the following people, who played pre-release 
versions of Book and Volume and who offered their thoughts and transcripts:

Ian Bogost
Jeremy Douglass
Josh Kellar
Ryan McDonald
Scott Rettberg
Dan Shiovitz
Emily Short
Dirk Stratton
Jill Walker
Hanna Wallach
Noah Wardrip-Fruin

Thanks to Andrew Suffield, Brian Rapp, Jose Manuel Garcia, Brian Kerr, Jeremy 
Rogers, and Andrew Plotkin for post-release bug reports.

Also, I'm very grateful that I was given the opportunity to read from 
pre-release versions of Book and Volume at The Richard Stockton College, at The 
Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania, and at the Maryland 
Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland.

Finally, thanks go to these Philadelphia coffeehouses, in which much of Book 
and Volume was written: Intermezzo, Crimson Moon, Capriccio, and The Last Drop.

The Town Square
You are standing in the middle of a pretty town square in the center of a 
nondescript New England town.  Like most any other nondescript New England 
towns, there's not much to see or do here, but maybe you'll find something 
amusing and enjoyable to do.

A shiny metal phone booth sits in the center of the square.

You grunt with all your might and heave the phone booth onto your shoulders.  
For a moment or two it looks as if you're not going to be able to lift it, but 
heroically you finally lift it high in the air!  Seconds later, however, you 
topple underneath the weight, and the booth crushes you fatally.  Geez!  Didn't 
I tell you not to pick up the phone booth?!  Isn't the name of this very game 
"Pick Up The Phone Booth and Die"?!  Man, you're dense.  No big loss to 
humanity, I tell ya.

    *** You have died ***

In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 3 turns, giving you the 
rank of total and utter loser, squished to death by a damn phone booth.

After dreams of swedish fish fountains and 5-cent space otter rides, you find 
yourself unwillingly dragged back into consciousness. You open your eyes slowly 
to the sight of a completely bare ceiling. Your thoughts swim aimlessly in your 
head, trying to figure out what was happening before you passed out.

"Hi there!" a chipper voice says. You raise your head and see the flashing 
light-eyes of a maintenance bot. "Seems like you were unconscious in the 
bathroom! I moved you here."

Oh yeah. You had been on a field trip with your class to the Plutonian 
Commonwealth museum, learning about ancient technology and the history of the 
braintree and lots of educational stuff. As always, you find things way more 
educational when combined with the results of your pharmaceutical class, so you 
got totally fruitbat flapjacks on yesterday's lesson. You guess it must have 
been too much for you and you passed out.

"Sorry, but the museum's already closed and your tour group has gone. Since 
you're not supposed to be here, we'll have to have the security guy take you to 
the police in the morning. In the meantime, I'm off duty, so -" the light-eyes 
of the maintenance bot die out as it goes into sleep mode.

Dang. You've taken so many liberties in pharmaceutical class, you'd have a ton 
of paperwork to do if the police end up taking you out of here. You're going to 
have to find an exit on your own.

Maintenance Room
You are in a sparse, small room with no decoration whatsoever. It stinks of 
garbage, metal and oil.  From here, you can go north into the main museum hall, 
west into a nasty little break room, and east down a smelly hallway.

A pile of fat black garbage bags take up most of the room.

Nearby, a maintenance bot squats, inactive and shut off.

You can also see a reminder note here.

Plutonian Commonwealth Museum, Grand Hall
Of all of the halls, this is the grandest. It even has a sweeping staircase 
going up to a balcony type thing that overlooks where you're standing. This 
room was created exclusively to house the magnificent braintree, which is in 
the center of the room. The maintenance room where you woke up is to the south, 
and an unobtrusive door with an excessively obtrusive padlock on it is to the 
east.

There's a placard above the padlocked door to the east.

You can also see a planter (in which is a magnificent braintree), a brain tank 
(empty), a transfer chair, a transfer pedestal, a display note and a warning 
sign here.

Business of late has been slow. But then, its been like that since the Cold War

Yard Sale
There are never enough tables for a yard sale.  The people who live here 
clearly have set out every table they own on the driveway in front of their 
house.  It's a mismatched array of card tables, a kitchen table, and a scarred 
white desk, all piled with miscellaneous junk.

One item catches your eye.  It's an old, dented strongbox, barely visible 
behind a huge box fan.

>I beg your pardon?

>(the old dented strongbox)
This strongbox is made of metal, and is a foot across in each dimension.  It is 
covered in rust and dented in a few places.  A tattered label on the lid reads

This is the job that all men in white coats dream of...a potential epidemic. 
The details were sparse but menacing - mysterious, unexplained deaths in the 
isolated Dales village of Skebdale. The authorities had no choice but to send 
you, their most experienced environmental health agent, to check things out. 
Unfortunately it looks more like a job for Bond than for Herriot...

Country Lane
A winding country road threads its way between old stone cottages and barns. 
Daffodils and snowdrops spring from the grass verges, adding a dash of colour 
to the grey walls and roofs. To your north, the sign of 'The Green Calf' swings 
in the sunshine, beckoning locals and tourists alike to pop in for a drink. 
There is a small garden to the south of the road which is attached, 
unsurprisingly, to a small house.

A short gravel track leads up to a wooden gate to your north-east.

Your car, a battered blue Volvo estate, is slewed across the grass verge, two 
wheels in the ditch.

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n

The Green Calf
This single-roomed inn is dominated by a long bar, topped with perfectly 
polished wood. The shelves behind the bar are stacked to breaking point with 
sparkling glasses and inviting bottles. A single beer pump protrudes forlornly 
from the bar at one end, but it is, unfortunately, un-manned, so you will have 
to cope without a drink. A well-oiled wooden door leads south-east into the 
street.

Old Tom, Old Dick, and Old Harry sit around the beer pump, whispering 
conspiratorially.

You are wearing a leaden overcoat stumbling down a hallway filled with strobe 
lights. Anxiety runs like an electric wire through your frame as you can feel 
the eyes upon you; eyes, forever-staring; eyes boring holes through your back; 
eyes peering out from translucent drawer-like plates in the hall. You hold your 
breath hoping somehow to black out, but the floor melts and the scene shifts. 

You are running down an endless plain on a moonless night, where the stars sit 
in judgement like needles waiting to fall upon you. It rains clocks and they 
pelt you as you run, dodging shattered stopwatches and blaring alarm clocks. 
The scene shifts again. 

Every action seems in slow-motion as though you were moving through time. You 
raise your head to look in the mirror and see yourself growing older, a year 
for every moment. You turn away and look back to see a skeleton staring back at 
you, its jaws gibbering madly. 

Then you are sleeping. A gentle touch upon your shoulder and you awake, 
blinking into focus a strange and yet uncannily familiar world. The abandoned 
parking lot and the broken streets keen with secrets just out of reach. Before 
you is the building. It lurks like a coiled dragon, a summation of fear and 
deadly challenge, of past and of present. You hear a final distant voice that 
seems a greeting as well as benediction, "This is the dark night of the soul."

Building
The building lurking before you, an endless night.
Release 17 / Serial number 030706 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11 S

Before the Building
The building rises before you, a hulking shadow, blocking out the stars above 
and disfiguring the moon. Windows upon windows pit its smooth obsidian surface, 
glinting like tiny gasoline-colored eyes. A garrulous display of floodlights 
spray up from the ground floor like failed fireworks, casting writhing shadows 
from the dense bushes that ring the building except where the sidewalk splits 
them asunder. The slate sidewalk continues from the building, between the 
hedges to end at your feet, eroded smooth.

South Entrance
Here, the sidewalk ends at double-glass doors, surrounded by hedges. The 
floodlights crouched near the building wall spew harsh fluorescent light 
upwards, making the doors nearly translucent. The wind sighs, rustling the 
hedges, and their shadows flicker in menacing serpent-shaped dances.

The yellowed glass doors are closed.

A sleek, black brick is mounted flush to the wall, blinking red. A narrow 
indentation bisects it left to right.

You can also see a spiky soft ball here.

  The voice still echoes in your head. "Remember--if the bunny is not dead by 
midnight, the countryside will be ruled by evil." 

  You shiver as you think of the people dead in the street with bite marks on 
their neck. The cattle dead by the hundreds. The stories of a rampaging vampire 
bunny. A chill runs up your spine. 

  And lastly, you remember the strangeness of the graveyard the last time you 
saw it. The misty fog surrounding it. And now you're in the graveyard, alone, 
armed only with your apple and your trusty quill pen.

McDonald's Hamburger Restaurant, Miami Beach, Florida (on your seat)
Not exactly the holiday of a lifetime. You've come here to investigate the 
mysterious disappearance of several UFOs in the Bermuda Triangle (which, as 
you've discovered, is not a triangle but a trapezium, stretching as far back as 
New Mexico), but the authorities have been doing everything they can to block 
you. The girl in the City Hall even pretended not to know what you were talking 
about! If you were the paranoid type, you'd suspect the aliens themselves were 
in on the conspiracy, but no, it's probably just the usual government cover-up.

All the same, it's best to lie low for a while. To avoid suspicion (not to 
mention the mosquitoes) you've camped down for the afternoon in this innocuous 
family restaurant, drinking coffee. And what better way to pass the time than 
play an Infocom game on your PalmPilot? You can't beat the old-school games, 
and in Infidel's case, you literally can't beat it. In fact, you've been stuck 
in the slab room for sixteen years. Sixteen years -- now that's entertainment.

Truth be told, though, that puzzle is starting to irritate you now. As is the 
foul-smelling vagrant who has seated himself at the table opposite you. To see 
such people in McDonald's of all restaurants! Standards really have fallen, and 
not just in the IF community.

bad-tempered warlocks, huge diamonds, dragons, and a giant empire to explore.

In a secret base far underneath Washington DC, decisions are made. Decisions 
that can - and will - affect the entire world. This is the base of the Special 
Secret Service, a worldwide organisation outside of petty international 
disputes, assigned to protect our planet at whatever cost from those things the 
general public are better off being ignorant of. On this particular day, a 
collection of the most important and least known people on the planet sat 
around the huge varnished conference table. 

 "OK," said Agent Llewellyn, opening the first of many boxes. "Who wants the 
Meat Feast?" 

 "Me," said Agent Yahtzee, putting his colt .357 back into his belt. 

 "What?!" piped up Agent Garrison. "Why should you get first choice?" 

 "It's quite simple, Chris," retorted Agent Yahtzee. "Whoever shoots the 
delivery boy first gets to choose first. It's the way it's always been." 

 Chris Garrison stared down his fellow crusader. "Arthur, you ALWAYS get first 
choice! No-one else regularly brings a gun to the meetings!" 

 Agent Pemberton, stood on the podium, took the silence as an opportunity to 
chip in. "If we can get back to the matter at hand, ladies and gentlemen, the 
Earth is facing horrid catastrophe once again." The assembled agents relaxed. 
They knew where they stood with horrid catastrophe. Robert Pemberton continued. 
"You-know-who is at it again. You-know-who has devised a way to travel back to 
his own dimension. Who am I talking about?" 

 Like bored teenagers watching a holiday camp entertainer with withering 
contempt, the agents chanted in unison, "Doctor Diablo." 

 Dr. Diablo was a sadist. One of the most twisted, evil sadists the multiverse 
has ever known. He came to this dimension after an accident in his own research 
laboratory which was, although a relief to the Special Secret Service of that 
universe, a pain in the arse for the SSS of this universe. Dr. Diablo's 
ultimate quest was to annihilate everyone in the human race but himself, but if 
he destroyed the Earth - as he is more than capable of - then, obviously, he 
would also die. Only when he had a certain pathway to another dimension would 
he set the timer for the Apocalypse Bomb, which was why the SSS endeavoured 
almost constantly to keep him in this universe. He was just that little bit 
less dangerous over here than over there. 

 "What master plan has he hatched this time?" inquired Agent Kastanet, 
twiddling with her ID tags. 

 "He means to use the mystical powers of a certain artefact, the location of 
which has been known to us for many decades now." 

 "You don't mean..." began Agent Llewellyn. 

    "... Hell's Cheesecake?" finished everyone else. 

 "The very same," said Agent Pemberton smugly. "As you know, the security in 
the Temple of Hell's Cheesecake is so tight that only one of us can get 
through, but as you know Diablo is a resourceful one. One of us will have to go 
to the temple and fetch the Cheesecake back here before Diablo gets there 
first." 

 "Who?" 

 "Who else? The only one of us who has skived off all his assigned missions for 
the last six months, and just sits on his arse all day stuffing his face with 
pizza?" 

 Agent Arthur Yahtzee looked up from his meal, pepperoni smeared over his face, 
and said, "Why's everyone staring at me?"

Temple of Hell's Cheesecake
After numerous adventures you have penetrated the very centre of the Temple, to 
this tiny little vault where the cursed dessert lies. The room is small and 
unordained, unlike the rest of the temple, with just crumbly yellow bricks 
forming the walls and concrete making up the floor and ceiling. The exit door 
is to the south and the centre of the room is dominated by a cylindrical 
podium.

On the podium is the cheesecake of Beezlebub.

    It is the year 2753.  You are engaged in a contest, a race across the 
galaxy to acquire the Toaster of Battle Creek Michigan (the last functioning 
toaster in the known universe, and therefore extremely valuable.)

    You like to win.  To ensure your success in this competition, you sabotaged 
the starships of the other participants.  Now you alone (or at least you and 
your faithful assistant Walter) have discovered the cavern of the Toaster.  
Gloatingly, you ordered Walter to lower you into the cave...

    But your rope snapped, and now you're trapped here - perhaps forever...

Treasure Chamber
This is one of the largest caverns you have ever been in.  The ceiling is forty 
feet up, and the walls are quite a ways away.  The ceiling is supported by 
massive pillars formed from stalactites and stalagmites.  The phosphorescent 
moss that lines the walls provides a dim glow.  Mysterious carvings have been 
left on one wall.  There is an opening to the east.

    In the center of the cave stands the object of your quest:  The massive, 
thirty-foot pedestal on which the legendary Toaster of Battle Creek has stood 
for centuries.

On the massive pedestal is the Toaster of Battle Creek.

This year too you decided to go for a walk to the book fair that takes place in 
the old town centre. After visiting the stand of the "Ludo Ergo Sum" club run 
by your friends Mario e Luigi, on the right side of the main street, you headed 
to Miky Bar to drink a beer to their health.

You're still having your drink when Mario bursts into the bar and says that the 
Cheshire Cat is missing! It is an unruly feline that meows all the time and 
pees and poos everywhere. But it is also the mascot of the club: without it 
your friends can't organize any other event, so it's a matter of life and death 
to find it as soon as possible.

Before letting you to your mission, Mario reminds you the rules to play a text 
adventure:

  - Every command has to be inserted with the syntax verb + noun: >get beer, 
>open door, >examine jacket, >wear hat, >ask girl about cat, >hit vandal...

  - To move from one place to another within the game world, you have to use 
the directions >north (or just n), >south (s), >east (e), >west (w), >up (u), 
>down (d).

  - The command >inventory (i) prints the list of the objects you have, while 
>look (l) shows the description of the place where you currently are.

  - The verbs you can use in this game are: get, examine, show and give 
[something to someone], ask and tell [someone about something], answer 
[something to someone], wait, sing, sleep, jump, listen, wear, remove, open, 
close, unlock, lock, hit, empty [something on something else], eat, drink, 
play, burn.

  - Examining the furnitures and the details mentioned in the descriptions of 
the places allows you to find hidden objects and important information. By 
speaking with the other characters you can know what you have to do to obtain 
their help.

you couldn't nail while wasting away at military school are out looking to meet 
interesting chaps like yourself and your compatriots. The 'Mick is kind of a 
meat-market (meaning that predators of both gender and varying sexual 
preference skulk about attempting to discern potential companionship for an 
evening... and the prey have no illusions about that). Your friends and 
co-workers Keegan and Pang have joined you. They're great guys to go 
bar-hopping with: Pang left to use the lavatory an eternity ago while Keegan 
just bolted to hit on a girl. They do, however, always have your back and allow 
you to be a complete assjack when you party together. You definitely lucked out 
in getting to know them as most of the people you meet at work are a bunch of 
stiffs. Tonight there really does seem to be an inordinate amount of sexy 
knock-outs to chat up. Pump it up, Avandre, and try not to bring your boys 
down!

You are up against the bar of Mick's Unwashed Outback Tavern and have a pretty 
solid view of the kids whom have come out tonight to party. Preps, goths, 
betties, freaks, cheerleaders, milfs, sorority types -- you've never seen the 
place so packed with such wholesome goodness. Fortunately it appears as if your 
competition contains an inordinate amount of chuds and losers.

Keegan returns, shaking his head. He briefly looks toward you. "God, she 
smelled like an absolute honeypot. And I don't mean that in a sexist way, I 
mean it literally. Like she had bathed in honeycomb or something." He takes a 
sip and continues. "I mean, I can deal with that, you  know? I told her I was 
having difficulty mating my plastic honey bear because the only other 
syrup-based lifeform I knew was Aunt Jemima and it didn't want to go hogging. I 
was about to ask her if she wanted to help out when she copped this major 
'tude. Apparently she was totally unaware what she smells like. Pfft. 
Clueless."

You nod. "Dude, no worries there. I'm guessing it would have ended badly when 
she got attacked by a swarm of yellowjackets right before you were about to 
drop the hammer."

Keegan grins at that, his morale restored. "Er, well, I also accidentally 
sneezed all over her. That probably had something to do with her rapid case of 
frostbite."

[ 'Twas Crisis -- All the length had passed
  That dull -- benumbing time
  There is in Fever or Event --
  And now the Chance had come --
   
  The instant holding in its claw
  The privilege to live
  Or warrant to report the Soul
  The other side the Grave.
   
  -- Emily Dickinson]

If it's not an adage, it ought to be: a lord asks no favor from a peasant. Yet 
there he was, in your own family's modest home, waving what used to be his hand 
in the air and looking at you with eyes full of supplication.

"You have proven yourself to be the ablest, cleverest, and wisest youth in the 
province, and it is to you we must turn to save us from this affliction, " 
insisted Lord Midel. He gestured with his transformed hand, which had become 
the paw of a lion, at the similarly changed appendages of your family members. 
Following the arc of his paw, you ended up looking down at your father's feet, 
changed into oxen hooves by the cruelty the wizard Marnian had inflicted on 
your poor province and everyone in it.

Your mother's dove wing fluttered anxiously as she looked at you through pained 
eyes, and said, "I fear for you, dear one, but perhaps you can find on your 
quest some means of restoring prosperity to our village, which has been too 
long poor." You gazed for the hundredth time at the too-worn, too-old cottage, 
at your transformed brother and sister, and at your own left hand, now the paw 
of a wolf, and finally turned to your lord, saying "There seems no other path. 
I accept your proposal."

Lord Midel clapped you on the shoulder and said, "It's settled then -- I 
believe you are the one who can save our people from this wearing of the claw. 
Find the Pendant of Elinor, as the wizard has demanded, and bring it back to 
me. It is the only thing that can save our province. Now come, for I am not 
without magic of my own."

You gathered your things, said a solemn farewell to your family, and followed 
Midel into the center of town, where he sprinkled a sparkling powder over you, 
and recited an incantation... and you suddenly found yourself alone on a dirt 
path, the cold wind assailing your face.

Isn't it always like that? You spent a hot morning chivvying the plow and the 
Bishop up and down the north field. No satisfaction there -- it's just to turn 
in the clover. The view and the Bishop's hind end never change -- a mule's ass 
no matter what you call the mule, and Reverd Pearson has lectured you enough 
about calling him "the Bishop," but you figure he's your mule so you can call 
him what you like -- the mule, that is, not Reverd Pearson -- anyway, a whole 
morning and now it's time to chop the wood, and your good axe has gone missing.

Reverd Pearson would say you're a careless lunkhead who'd lose his ear if it 
wasn't nailed on. You figure he's right, a man of the cloth, but that doesn't

Your Front Room
Reverd Pearson says a man's home is his fortress. Your home is two rooms of 
dressed timber, but the roof doesn't leak, so that's fine. Not enough of a 
fortress to keep out the piskeys, though, it seems. The front door is west, and 
east is where you sleep in back.

A maplewood table stands in the center of this room. It's your home's pride 
(though the Reverd has warned you about pride) -- a handsome furnishing that 
your cousin down the road made for you when your house was raised. Every time 
you walk in you're pleased to see it. Only there should be an axe leaning 
against the table's corner, and there isn't.

A battered book is lying on the table, though.

Would you like to restore a saved game?
Please answer yes or no.>  "Greetings Almighty! Allow me to tell you about your world, Aarkland."

Our story begins here.

The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from early morning 
until all that must be done is done. The summer has been good and this winter 
no one will starve. That is what the villagers believe, anyway. In ignorance 
they have turned from you and cannot see the coming darkness. For them 
Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see the truth is no protection against 
evil.

The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You watch her 
treading along the road and when she stops next to the water, you once more 
feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in more than a hundred years 
that has been born with the old power. The youngest daughter to Lorne and Noki, 
this innocent girl searches the sky for your presence. She smiles when she 
senses it and gives you a little wave. She is the last one. The last hope. 

Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance back along 
the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly. Surely she can 
sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She reaches into her rucksack and 
brings out some bread. She nibbles on it without much enthusiasm while watching 
the flowing river, and she waits for you.

The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and "heal" what 
is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a difference. Not without 
guidance. That is where you come in. As the God of this land, you must guide 
her. First, you should send her to the unholy stones to see what the world 
around her is hiding.

Aarkland (End of Village Road)
This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the forest. 
Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river Aarkland. The river 
flows through the forest and divides it in two: To the east is the old forest, 
and to the west is the forbidden forest.

Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by grass and 
brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east. Between the swaying 
grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare to invade what remains of the 
road. A short distance to the southeast is a pile of stones. The stones are 
barely visible above the grass.

The Aarkland river flows past as always.

A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves the 
unpleasant odor away.

>No, she can go east to the field, southeast to the unholy stones, or enter the 
river to the west.
Lornedei suddenly looks startled.
"Master what is this?" A firefly is buzzing around her head. She waves her hand 
to wave it away when suddenly a small voice pipes up.
"No, No, silly girl. I am no harm! I am here to help you must know!" Lornedei 
stops waving but she looks dubiously at the tiny creature. Once safe from the 
terribly waving arm, the firefly stops for a rest on Lornedei's brow. The tiny 
voice pipes up again. "I must come, curious am I, and I can help such as you!" 
Lornedei tries to look up at the fly but all that happens is that her eyes 
cross. "There is magic here, magic in you girl. I have not sensed magic in a 
long time, yes!" the fly takes off and starts buzzing around Lornedei's head 
again. "Strong you are not! Oh, no. That god of yours was stingy in his giving 
so he was. Pity, pity. You can be stronger though. Sometimes from nature, 
sometimes from other things. You must know girl, to regain strength that you 
lose, you must eat. Ah, there are some here, I have searched for these." the 
fly buzzes off towards the deformed bushes and lands on one of the berries 
growing there. "Eat these and be strong, do not forget." there is an angry 
buzzing, a strange grunting sound, and a thud as a white berry, seemingly with 
a firefly attached on the top, falls to the ground. "Me... Will just.." In an 
amazing display of over-insectile powers, the fly lifts the berry off the 
ground. "will just take this." The firefly, along with its booty, disappears 
with a pop and a flash.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively 
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem 
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But 
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

"Los Angeles, California. City of Angels." 

"Not so fast, Sherlock; I'm no angel." She pauses, the cigarette poised an inch 
from her lips. A stray beam of sunlight leaks from a broken slat in the 
venetian blinds, spotlighting her hair. Blonde. Platinum, not gold. Abruptly, 
she reaches across your desk to push a stack of green at you, past the halfway 
point. Her eyes watch yours as she fans the money out on the desktop. "I never 
mix business with pleasure. Do you?" 

Not often. Not lately. "Not me," you assure her. "Wouldn't dream of it." 

She leans back in the chair, studies the smoke curling from the cigarette 
between her fingers. "I--we don't visit L.A. much anymore. My husband, he hates 
it; won't go near the place. Calls it the City of Angles. Says everybody's got 
one, you know? An angle, I mean." 

"Your husband sounds like a man with his head screwed on tight." 

She laughs, a short, bitter sound with no amusement behind it. "That night, I 
did go to L.A. Without Walter. When I got home, late, the cops were waiting for 
me." She kills the cigarette with a quick stab at the ashtray. "If Walter dies, 
I'll inherit millions. My alibi--well, let's just say it doesn't help. Get the 
picture?" 

Her old man was right, everybody's got an angle, even dames with more curves 
than a mountain road. A guy could hurt himself on all that geometry.

Fremont Office Building
Inside Room 401 (on your wooden swivel chair)
Welcome to your executive office suite. Private. Furnished. Centrally located. 
Paid for this month--if all goes well--by the beautiful and wealthy Jessica 
Kincaid. Never mind the filthy window with a crack across one corner. Or the 
furniture that lost its polish years before you gained yours. Or the perpetual 
smell of onions from the diner across the street. What needs to work, does. 
You, mostly.

The door to the hall is north.

Jessica Kincaid is parked in the wing chair.

You can also see your desk (on which are a telephone, an ashtray and five 
twenty-dollar bills). In the ashtray is a Chesterfield cigarette butt.

>"Whatever."

From her handbag, Jessica extracts a newspaper clipping and unfolds it. "I 
don't know whether you've been following this case," she continues, "but here's 
a sample of what I'm up against." She reads:

"'Police have intensified their investigation into the brutal hit-and-run of 
real estate tycoon Walter Kincaid, who remains hospitalized since late Friday 
night. Although no witnesses to the incident have come forward, several people 
reported seeing a late-model white Jaguar convertible speeding through the area 
minutes before Kincaid was discovered. By all accounts, the driver, a blonde 
woman in her mid-twenties, was driving in a reckless and erratic manner. 
Authorities have not yet located the automobile; however, a similar vehicle is 
believed to belong to the victim's wife, who was not at home when the incident 
occurred.'" 

She glances up. "In case you haven't guessed, my car is a brand new '48 white 
Jag convertible. Or, rather, it was. It's missing." She wads the article into a 
ball and stuffs it back into her purse. "I'm in trouble, shamus. Deep trouble. 
I need you to get me out of it."

>(getting off your wooden swivel chair)
(opening the door to the hall)

Abruptly, Jessica Kincaid stalks past you into the corridor, an angry frown on 
her face. "If you don't need the money or the job," she snaps, "I'll find 
someone who does." The staccato of her high heels fades as she marches down the 
stairs and out of your life.

A few days later, you read in the paper that Walter Kincaid has died. The cops 
arrest Jessica as she leaves her husband's funeral, her dismay captured by a 
frenzy of popping flashbulbs and published on the front pages of newspapers 
throughout the state. After a long and public trial, she is convicted of his 
murder. You spend the next six months in an alcoholic stupor.

    *** You have failed to do your job. ***

In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 2 turns, earning you 
absolutely nothing, not even a kiss on the cheek.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move, give the 
FULL score for that game or QUIT?

The spirits called you each off to one side. Said they had riddles. You'd boned 
up on mythological puzzles and even guessed the stab wound/hanged man and 
puddle of water right your first time; You felt confident, but you got 
straight-out math.

Your pal wanted a beautiful wife--thought he'd get a lady-and-tiger deal but 
instead had to choose number one of a thousand and one. At least he got time to 
browse.

You had to go with writing the perfect song. Beautiful women would follow. 
Nobody said you'd get to sing it, though. Still, you've got at least a chance 
in a thousand--well, a thousand and one--of getting it right. Maybe even 
better.

One of these doors ahead holds that song--it's all you, but universal, as well. 
The other thousand? Gulp.

Fingertips - I Walk Along Darkened Corridors
An Interactive Fiction by Andrew Schultz
Release 1 / Serial number 120323 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) 

The Room of 1001 Doors
Ten paths branch in front of you, to ten darkened stairways each, with five 
doors on each side of the stairways. You'll have to walk down one of them. 
Well, actually, there's door 1001. It seems boarded up for effect, but it's got 
drawings on it.

You hear a hum in the distance--sounds like a natural A. A muscular statue 
holding a "Best Left Fullback Ever" trophy is in the center, and a starry-eyed 
statue is carrying a big not-quite-ball with a tag dangling from it. The tag 
reads "Virgo."

You see a table of fractions and a yellowed chart of football positions here, 
and a small billboard with five electronically rendered dice seems to provide a 
diversion.

You can see an angel with a pitchfork and a devil with a halo here.

>...there's not much to do here. You suspect the spirits have seen all the fancy 
end-arounds before, and sooner or later you'll be forced to ENTER DOOR (1-1001) 
to have a chance at winning--you can also shorthand to, say, DOOR 17, ENTER 17, 
or 17. (For those familiar with text adventures, you can also try standard 
verbs a few times for minor amusement.)

Otherwise, you should pretty much just EXAMINE what you see for clues.

Oh, you can wait around, too, if you want something easier. The spirits'll 
relent. A bit.

>That was a rhetorical question.

>You pick a room at random. Specifically, room 874.

As you step through the door, you realize the floor underneath was illusory. 
You have chosen wrong, falling into a vortex of--well, you don't know what it 
is, but you know it gives you that perfect song.

In that song you realize everyone has that sort of song when they die, that 
it's the last one and it trumps all factual knowledge and regret--in this case, 
you never find time--or whatever's beyond time--to lament not choosing door 
185.

...or do you?

From beyond the void, you hear mumbling about not filling out the paperwork, 
cutting corners even imps know not to, a poor sucker who's actually lucky 
enough, and how that one djinni learns a lesson. You remember none of this, so 
you don't feel the least bit grateful or lucky when you find yourself back 
in...

Crypt (in the coffin)
Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your immortal 
body for centuries, while your foolish enemies spent their miserable days 
hunting for you in your castle. The coffin is on a stone pedestal at the centre 
of the room. On the ceiling is a fresco of the red sun of Valmar. To the east a 
narrow tunnel leads to the other rooms of your lair.

You're lying in the coffin, very weak. You struggle to keep your eyes open, 
while your necrotic flesh recovers its former appearance. You feel a stab of 
pain as you remember the stake that was driven through your heart. You should 
be dead, but you aren't. Something happened.

It was only seconds ago that the sound of a gunshot caught you off guard.  Now, 
here you are, cradling your sidekick and friend, Snam, close to the ground.  
"Not Snam!!" you think to yourself, "After all he's done for me..."  It was he 
who took care of your niece when your sister asked you to babysit.  It was he 
that always let you win in Stratego. Now, in this final act of selflessness, he 
lies dying from a shot from Doctor Nova's gun, leaking life from the very 
bullet that was meant for you.  Tears well up in your eyes when you think how 
Snam will never get that plant you got him for his birthday.  You spent so much 
time picking it out and everything...

Your attention is diverted by an evil chortle, and your gaze barely catches the 
blur of white as Doctor Nova runs out the door to the north.  You'll pursue him 
soon enough, but for now, your attention returns to your fallen comrade.

"Listen," Snam chokes out. "You gotta get that bastard." After these final 
words, his body promptly goes limp in your hands.  You carefully lower him to 
the floor.

"Oh, I'll get him alright," you growl to yourself as you turn towards the door. 
 "I'll get him good."

The Beginning of the End
You and Snam came a long way to get this far.  First, you had the trouble of 
tracking down clues and following the trail of innocent victims that led you 
here.  Then, there was the battle of epic proportions with Nova's countless 
minions.  To top it off, you had to deal with that dastardly crocodile pit (and 
you would've helped Snam wrestle them, too, if only reptile skin didn't make 
you feel so icky).

But now, Snam's dead and you've got to make things right.

You have an ominous, uneasy feeling, walking about this room. You're not sure 
whether to attribute this to the eerie, curious shadows that dart about the 
floor and walls or to the fact that you made the unwise decision to fight evil 
with a stomach full of chili. The doorway to the north seems to be your only

Darkness; below, percussion throbs softly. You shift from foot to foot, 
conscious of too much open space around you.

Ahead and on either side, the voice of the chorus rises; as they speak, the 
lights slowly go up.

CHORUS:
Now does the hour grow close; where feet lack time,
And Spaniards rage before the Cockrel's gate,
The condemned sinner, soul turned sick of vice,
Shall craft before your eyes most unclean magics,
Open him a gate to Hell's black womb,
Release demons, and bid them convey
Our heroes to fair France; there to signal
Embattl'd men to a final desperate measure.
The final act is begun; the play is in your hands.

Stage (A German Forest)
You are onstage, a wide expanse of blank floor facing onto darkness. Nestled 
behind a curtain's edge is the exit leading offstage.

The backdrop features an unconvincing painting of pine-covered mountains and a 
dark, ominous sky in which a double-headed eagle is carrying off a schnitzel.

*An implosion of Purpose* 

A summons from mere existence.  The scattered undercurrents of Purpose 
integrated me, established meaning.

A wish diminished me.  I fulfilled my summoner's desire expending Purpose.  I 
returned to my container before I was lost forever.

Vault Entry Room
The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the world 
[physically west] and a complex of vaults [physically east].

The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room, a portcullis 
barred the way to the outside.  To the other were the vaults for storage.  A 
patterned stone wall blocked their unauthorized access.

The remains of a former summoner rested there.  An emerald had taken the place 
of his head.

The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.

>no
If I needed to answer, I [talked to "summoner"].

Seegan stared at me.  Her eyes had the typical glaze of awe but lacked the 
typical glimmer of San.

>n
I was not impeded by the elements of the physical world.  The farther I 
traveled from the location of my initial summons, the more Purpose I expended.

Then too I realized where I was and could [recall the area] whenever I needed.

When you saw the ugly little doll in the shop window you knew you had to have 
it. It would make a great addition to your collection of mysterious items and 
artifacts.

The doll stood only about a foot tall and seemed to be made of a tough leathery 
material. Its head was small and misshapen, and its long, razor-sharp teeth 
could be seen protruding from its mouth. It wore a little gold talisman around 
its neck and wielded a cute little six inch sword. The sign read "Genuine 
African Zuni Doll. Only $19.99"

After bringing it home and taking it out of the box you read the little 
information sheet that came with it.

                              "African Zuni Doll"

"It is said that the Zuni Doll is inhabited by the spirit of an African 
Tribesman who died while committing a cowardly act. In order to let the 
deceased regain his lost honor, the tribe's witch doctor imprisoned the man's 
spirit in a doll and a talisman that he created especially for that purpose. 
The spirit remains trapped until it atones for the cowardice the tribesman 
committed and proves its bravery. To accomplish this, the Zuni Doll must 
complete a near impossible task: hunt and kill, 25 human.

"Fortunately, the Zuni Doll is harmless as long as it continues to wear the 
gold talisman. The magic in the talisman keeps the Zuni Doll from coming to 
life and carrying out its mission of blood."

Now, you are lying in bed thinking of the little doll when you feel a slight 
pressure near your feet. Looking down you see your cat, Elmo, crawling towards 
you. You reach down and give Elmo a good scratch behind the ears. That is when 
you notice something small and golden drop from his mouth.

Bedroom (on the bed)
This room is small but serves its purpose well. The floor is carpeted with a 
soft green rug and the walls are mostly bare except for a painting depicting a 
lush pastoral scene. A window set in one wall gives a beautiful view of the 
city. The main living room is to the east and your bathroom is to the south.

The bathroom door is open.

Beside the bed is a small wooden table.

On the table is an ornately decorated glass lamp.

A small golden Talisman lies in your lap where Elmo deposited it.

A clean white sheet is draped over the top of the bed.

Elmo is cureled up on the bed resting peacefully.

Don't Go
A bedroom. On the right is a bed, and a bookcase behind it. From the window 
across, beams of light are gliding inside. You can see a part of a building 
through the window.

Walls are white. A picture of flower is on the wall. A red rose with a black 
background. The bed with white sheets is undone.

A man with straggly hair in pajamas with dark blue stripes, is walking to left. 
He has fuzzy slippers. He's scratching his butt.

The reaching big white hand of the bed is about to hold the man from behind.

"Aye.  There's treasure to be found in those woods," came the words floating 
across the noisy pub like a magic incantation.

There! At two-o'clock.  A crusty old codger, bent toward his equally old and 
craggy companion.  The second man nods his head at every word the first one 
says.

"Yessir, if I were thirty years younger," the old man continues, "I'd go after 
it meself.  But this treasure...this treasure's for a younger man.  One oo's 
still got 'is strength 'n' wits about 'im - but one that ain't afraid o' dyin' 
neither.  'Cause that's what'll be waitin' for 'im, most likely. Least if 'e's 
not clever enough." 

The old man leans back, and then continues, "Yeah.  It's the Demon all right.  
'As to be.  Yessir.  When I was young, my daddy tolt me stories 'bout that 
Demon.  Stories that would curl my socks, I tell ya!  Yeah. 'Long time ago this 
all 'appened a'fore. Same Demon, too, I bet.  Mean, nasty thing. "Caused a lot 
of trouble. 'specially 'round Pheebor 'n' Borphee. 'Cuz them's was the ritchest 
places around back then.  Juss like now.  An' that Demon 'ad a mighty sweet 
tooth for loot. Yessir.  Must 'ave some kind o' secret cave or 'ideout to keep 
it in.  Probly in them woods. 

"Yeah, if I were a younger man I'd be lookin'.  But I ain't got that many years 
left nomore and the few I got, I wants to keep.  Yessir, this one 'll 'ave to 
go to some youngster, if e's lucky."

Inside the Hut

Two days later, in a small, abandoned hut between Borphee and Pheebor...

It was good fortune to find this abandoned hut.  Secluded, yet not far from 
Borphee or Pheebor, it is a perfect site for your new base of operations.

The warm air inside is a bit stifling, while creaking sounds from the bamboo 
construction suggest that it is not entirely stable.

The only exit, an open doorway, is south.

You can also see a cot and a table (on which are some maps and a lantern) here.

Come with me on dragon wings to wicked woods, where night's black agents to
    their preys do rouse."

An open field

 As night approaches, and thick storms rise out from troubled skies.
   Like a spectre you appear.
   Called by a clap of thunder.

A messenger of death, the ghastly owl flutters, and with dreary shrieks he 
passes you by.

From somewhere far away a church bell sounds some early hour. Its sound crawls 
slowly through cold, mist laden air. 
A dead chime.

The bell has called you.
Out of space, out of time...

It is night. You find yourself standing in a grass field, surrounded by dark, 
shadowy trees. To the NORTH, the back stones of some ruined gothic structure 
rises high into the nights sky, silhouetted against a blood red moon.

It's black empty, windows, like eyes watch you far below.

>That was a rhetorical question.

Tell me what to do.
>
Abbey ruins
As you walk through the mist towards the ruins you see a sign that reads.

"WHITBY ABBEY."

With a crack of thunder, through darkened air a flash of lightning comes, so 
broad and so bright, the Abbey seems on fire.

From high up, within one of the empty windows, the figure of a woman appears. 
Half hidden in the lions roar of the thunderclap, she calls to you.

"Why came you here?
Unwise...unwise...unwise!"

Lightning flashes, and when you look again she is gone.

All around you are the stone ruins of Whitby Abbey. A noble ruin of immense 
size.

Beautiful once.

Now all that is left are the great, dark walls. Their immense black stones 
eroded away by a century of sea wind.  From high up, two empty windows watch 
your progress far below. To the NORTH, beyond the Abbey's stone wall, you can 
hear the sea crashing against the rocks far below.

SOUTH leads to an open field, while a path leads WEST.

What next?
>(the letter)
You already have that.

What now?

You wrench your eyes open. Rough grey stone. Grey stone ceiling. Your head 
hurts, and -- You're lying on the floor. You're staring at the ceiling, and 
it's rough and grey, and you don't recognize it.

You roll slowly (smooth cold floor?) and try to sit up. It hurts. You crawl 
upright. The walls, rough stone also, scrape your aching fingers. You can't -- 
there was white agony, felt like raw light tearing you apart. You can't 
remember anything after that.

You can't remember anything before that. Gone. You clutch at memory, and 
there's nothing but empty air.

This space, barely wider than outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw

You pull on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, collect your books and head out 
for class. Gregory Dumont, Ph.D. is giving one of his crash courses in physics 
and you swore this time you'd get the stuff down cold.

As you approach the classroom the smell of popcorn wafts through the door, and 
you find Dumont inside, showing a Marx Brothers movie to an empty room.

"Oh! So we have a class! Welcome!" Dumont says excitedly as he ushers you in. 
He looks at the film for a moment, chuckles, then switches it off. "Since it's 
just the two of us, and it's a nice day, why don't we walk over to the Research 
Zone? I'm working on an experiment there," Dumont says, scratching his wild 
frizzy hair then reaching for his coat. "We can consider it a lab class."

The Research Zone, shrouded in mystery since the last big experiment blew the 
roof off the billion-dollar facility, has been off limits to students. You are 
honored that Dr. Dumont is allowing you, a lowly physics student, access to a 
privileged area.

After walking for what feels like miles down the brightly lit twisty hallways 
of the Research Zone, Dumont stops abruptly and opens a door. Fumbling for a 
light switch inside, you hear him cursing under his breath, "Ah, here it is!" 
and the room is washed in light.

Inside there are mounds of books, magazines, popcorn, clustered around a 
massive wooden desk while across the room is a curtained area. Dumont sees you 
eyeing the curtain. "Shall we see what's behind curtain number three?" he asks 
you with a sly smile.

He pulls the curtain back briskly and a chill runs up your spine. There, amidst 
a tangle of wires, computers and a huge wall poster of the university's 
underground particle smashing cyclotron, sits a gleaming, black, human-shaped 
shell the size of a sports car. The lid is open.

"You see, it's quite simple. Particle physics isn't particle physics without 
human observation--it's just particles. So, when we insert one human, voila! 
Particle physics!" Dumont looks at you with a gleam in his dark blue eyes. 
"You're not taking notes?" he asks as he walks to a computer console.

Slowly, he fingers a few buttons while lost in some unfathomable thought 
processes, his gaze intent on the black shell. Luckily, he seems to be busy 
with things other than you.

Just as you start to think it might be prudent to find your way out through the 
labyrinthine hallways, he pulls up a lab stool for you to sit on. There is an 
intensity about him that rivets your attention. You can feel his excitement as 
he looks inside the black shell, checking wires that run along the inside.

"The shell is linked to the A.I. computer, which is linked to the cyclotron. 
The computer will learn from interacting with the human mind how to view the 
elusive particle which has escaped our detection so far--Particle X. Sort of a 
creative jump start, if you will," he says. "The computer just doesn't have the 
intelligence needed by itself."

Dumont sheds his coat and reaches for a white lab coat draped over a chair. 
"Now, the A.I. machine loads metaphors into the human brain for what is going 
on inside the cyclotron. And the human brain, being creative, tries to find 
meaning within the metaphors and, ultimately, views Particle X. Once that 
happens, the A.I. computer adjusts, learns, and becomes a particle viewing 
machine. And then, voila! The human can go home and get some sleep!"

He pulls the lab coat on and excitedly jabs a few buttons on the computer. 
"Then, you ask, what must it be like inside the shell, linked to a metaphor of 
the sub-atomic world?" You weren't even thinking of asking that. You were 
thinking of asking if you could transfer into another physics class. Any other 
physics class. "Now that's the interesting part," he continues. "I did most of 
the programming for P.A.R.T.I. myself--Particle Accelerator and Reality 
Translation Integrator.'

Dr. Dumont begins to pick up speed as he talks, whisking you and your 
imagination along with him. He grabs the lapels of his own lab coat as if to 
shake himself. "There's a shortcut to genius inside of P.A.R.T.I. somewhere, 
but you know I'm afraid the metaphors will be too personal for just anybody to 
make sense of them, too much of my own personality, my likes and dislikes."

He shakes his head, "But who knows?!! They won't let me try it out! I could be 
the first human to experience sub-atomic life, but do they give me that honor? 
Nooooo!" Dumont gestures wildly as he talks. "They've decided to train a 
subonaut, someone who will be groomed for the mission."

He throws back his mane of wild hair and laughs. "Subonaut! Sheesh!" He paces 
across the room then turns to you. "The experience will take only a few 
moments, but it won't feel that way to the person inside the shell. Time will 
be suspended and drawn out, rather dramatically I suspect."

Dr. Dumont leans forward, peers at you as if to see whether you've taken it all 
in, then steps over to the shell. He adjusts a wire inside the shell.

"If I could just make a few adjustments, but the darn subonaut hasn't been 
selected yet..."

He turns his piercing blue gaze on you, "Would you mind? Getting in the shell I 
mean? Just for a moment? I only need the physical dimensions of a body, yours 
will do fine," he says happily, gesturing to the awaiting interior.

You look at the black acrylic shell, not so chilling as when you first laid 
eyes on it. Dumont seems so intent on adjusting those wires in the shell, you 
feel compelled to help him out. Maybe this will even boost your grade, you 
speculate, as you slide into the contours of its inner dimensions. Dumont 
reaches over you to bring down the biolink electrodes, attaching the small 
wired disks to your temples, your arms, torso, and legs.

"Now, where did I put that screwdriver?" Dumont ruminates, as he disappears out 
of sight for a second.

The second draws out. You get fidgety. You hear the deep thrumming of the 
particle accelerator, feel its vibrations through the shell. Dumont doesn't 
seem to be returning. As you pull yourself up for a peek, your hand hits 
something along the outer edge of the shell and you hear an ominous click. The 
black shell quickly begins to close as you get a glimpse of Dumont running 
across the room shouting, "Oh my Gosh! Stop! Wait!" and then the shell lid 
clicks securely shut.

The last thing you hear is Dumont shouting, "This isn't going to get you an A, 
you know!" before you black out.

You're in a bedroom. Everything about this room seems normal on one level and 
yet oddly different on another. A quick scan around the room makes you 
ill-at-ease, as if you don't belong here. Or perhaps the room itself doesn't 
belong anywhere. A dresser complete with a mirror lies off to one side, against 
a white, featureless wall. A door is off to the west while to the south,

Welcome to a day in the life of Betty Byline! Two months out of journalism 
school you enter the workplace with big time dreams of network television news. 
Fame, fortune and glory, all writ large under the unrelenting gaze of the klieg 
lights. There are eight million stories in the Naked City, and it's your job to 
tell them, tell them best, and tell them first.

Unfortunately this isn't the Naked City. This is Pleasantville, USA, population 
50,000. And you're not exactly working for the network news. You're working for 
local television station KTKO, the Knockout News Team -- a one camera, one 
reporter operation with a fat, balding old news director who smokes cheap 
cigars. Forget fortune and glory, for now your big career objective is not to 
have to give too many on-air endorsements of "Kletus's Used Car and Farm 
Implement Emporium." OK, so maybe you're not Dan Rather yet. Everybody has to 
start somewhere, and at least this is a start in front of a camera.

Your day begins in the KTKO newsroom, sitting at your desk. It may be yours, 
but right now your boss is treating it as his. His chair, specifically. Harry 
Jenkins is the news director at KTKO, and at the moment he has his chubby 
cheeks perched on the edge of your workspace. "Betty," he says, "I've got one 
whale of a first assignment for you. Word on the street is that the mayor and 
his latest intern have been stuffing the ballot box, so to speak. It's time for 
that adversarial relationship with the government they taught you about in J 
School. Get out there and get me the scoop!

"I know this is a lot to drop on you for your first day at work," he says. "But 
this station can only afford one reporter, so if I had someone more experienced 
to cover it, you wouldn't even have a job. I'll do my best to help you. 
Anything you turn up, anything anyone tells you, feel free to come ask me about 
it. And if you turn up any evidence we can use, tell me about it, and I'll help 
you figure out what to do with it."

As he hoists his heinie off your desk, Harry turns to look back one last time. 
"And don't think you're getting an exclusive! I'm hearing that Walker from the 
Daily Post is working the same story. This is big news, Betty! Get it for me 
before the Post, or get a new job!"

Jack Walker! You heard his name as soon as you came to town. He's the ace 
reporter for the local newspaper, KTKO's only competition. Well, if you want to 
make a splash, scooping the town's best reporter would be a good beginning. 
Start pounding the pavement, Betty. Your deadline is five PM.

KTKO Newsroom
Your home away from home, KTKO's newsroom. This is where you spend your days, 
when you're not out in the field asking old ladies how they feel about their 
cat having been rescued from a tree by the firemen.

It's all too quiet. No clatter of teletypes and keyboards, no colleagues 
shouting into the phone. There's just a radio playing "adult contemporary" 
music, and a window looking out on the sprawling streets full of ranch-style 
houses that make up Pleasantville. The only exit is to the north.

Rachel the camerawoman is here.

occasionally takes a break from polishing her nails to answer the phone. North

Mitsey, KTKO's receptionist, sits at her desk polishing her nails.

Mitsey slaps her forehead. "Oh!" she exclaims. "I forgot to give Harry that 
message from two hours ago!"  She leaps out of her seat, dashes back to the

 "Another thrilling day at Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School," you 
think, with studied irony, as you get off the bus, trying to look as cool and 
bored as the other eighth graders. In truth, though, you really are a little 
excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special 
job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the 
building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on 
whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.

You are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen-year old eighth grade student at the 
only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls 
in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being "The 
Coldest French-Named Town in the EN-tire US of A." Today's temperature does 
nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.

As you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate 
from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster 
advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. 
The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick 
trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your 
school day starts.

The Enterprise Incidents
A Middle School Fantasy 
by Brendan Desilets
Release 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

The Cafe
The Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned 
room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, 
though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the 
north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of 
the day are stored.

Mr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his 
fifties and is wearing a "Save the Children" tie. 

"Hi!," he says. "It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the 
closet, Doug." He gives you a brass key. "Judy will be working with you, and so 
will the new girl who's joining us today.

"Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy 
handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The 
new girl will serve mainly as an observer.

"All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards 
and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in 
the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like."

"Any questions about your job today?"

Judy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and 
pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.

The new girl is known by the odd nickname "Queenie," or so you've been told.  
She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not 
especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek. 

Judy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. 
Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, "Yes, 
Judy."

"Can I go the bathroom?" Judy inquires. 

Mr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, "I don't think 
that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll 
answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your 
own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to 
make your own hygienic choices."

"OK," she comments amiably.

entire landscape while ashen clouds form dark and foreboding shapes in an angry 
red sky. The earth trembles from dislocated tectonic plates and the atmosphere 
is quickly becoming unbreathable and unlivable. A smoking forest can be seen to

Eric The Power-Mad Dungeon Master
by Mark Arenz
(c) 2004

[9:38pm on a Saturday in 1981.  D&D night at Eric's]

Long ago ... in the time of Arbaldu, lord of the short forest- or something 
like that-
Josh: Can we just get on with this?
Everybody shut the hell up!  This is how things go every time I DM, and I'm 
sick of it.  You guys seem to think you can back-sass the Dungeon Master and 
get away with it.   Well, just remember that I have the power to smite you all 
at will.
Brad: You keep saying that, Eric, but I'm not convinced that you know what it means.

My finger is on the smiting button right now.  Don't test me.

[MORE]

Oh, a little bad news first.  Some Yoohoo may or may not have been spilled on 
the new map.
Josh: You've got to be kidding.
Mistakes were made, alright?  Get over it.  The good news is that I memorized 
the whole thing when we were making it last week, so everything will be fine 
like cherry wine.  Let's get started.

Large and ancient trees surround you in this perfectly circular clearing.

Looking at the smudge on the map, I'm pretty sure you can head North or 
Southwest from here.

You can see a blue chip here.

From the trampled grass here, you can tell this is a heavy traffic area.  This 
is no wonder since paths lead off in most directions from the spot where you 
now stand.  Off to the West, you hear a subtle gurgling sound.  To the East you 
can see the gates of a small town.

As we sew the tapestry of our lives, we work with only one thread at a time.  
Some are bright, some dark, some with colors we can't quite describe.

At the moment, you are working with one particularly dull, frayed thread, and 
one sorry excuse for a needle.  The events of the past year are immaterial 
right now.  All you know is that "home" is not what it used to mean, and this 
is not where you want to be.

If you could just get away... even for an hour or two.

Living Room
This is the cultural center of apartment F209.  Its true symbolic magnificence 
is once again belied by its current squalid nature.  You wonder for a while how 
anyone could actually live in a place like this, until you remember that you 
pay the rent here.  The endless white of the undecorated walls is interrupted 
only by a hallway to the south, the kitchen to the east, and the front door to 
the north.

The front door is closed, displaying its chipped, off-white countenance with 
pride.

A large, selfish cat stares at you impatiently.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n
You can't, since the front door is in the way.

The cat sneers at you, and leaves to the south.

>take

<< the foggy street >>

The is fog everywhere, obscuring the entire landscape. Max feels suddenly like 
a huge cloud has lifted him up and taken him away. He wonders where he has 
gone.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n

<< the theatre >>

Max is onstage. He is dressed in kahki fatigues. His head is shaved. He is 
playing the part of man trapped inside his own skin. Three other people, his 
"family" try to tell he is alright. But he is not alright. He is misunderstood. 
He cannot even begin to articulate how he feels. But there is a panic inside 
him, growing more desparate by the moment. He begins to scoop water out of a 
large metal pot and watch it trickle back. he does this for some time. the 
movement comforts him. then the panic strikes again. He spies something shiny 
in the water. He reaches in and grasps the object and hurls it into the air. A 
huge fish flies across the stage and lands wetly a few feet away. Everyone is 
suddenly very quiet.

A huge fish lies at your feet.

You are now carrying the huge fish.

You drift awake from blackness, laying on your back. A groan escapes your lips 
as you try to move against a feeling of terrible weariness throughout your 
body.  You suddenly realize that you have no idea where you are, or even who 
you are.

This could be the start of a very bad day.

The Care and Feeding of Adjuncts.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
Release 1 / Serial number 080116 / Inform 7 build 5J39 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/11N) 

Formless Void
A formless void.  Empty.  Dull.  There appears to be no way out.  Still, better 
than Detroit.

You can see an Overused Cliche here.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>Do you really think one part of a formless void is more interesting than 
another?  Of course not.  Better just to stay here and not waste the effort.  
Sigh.

>(the Overused Cliche)
As you reach for the overused cliche, it moves tantalizingly out of your grasp, 
kind of like that pencil you dropped under the couch.  You lunge for it and 
somehow manage to bump your forehead on the formless void just like you did 
with the couch and pencil.  How you managed to bump your head on a formless 
void you cannot begin to understand.

The bump begins to hurt a bit and your eyes blur.  Suddenly everything goes 
dark yet again and you begin to wonder if another overused cliche wandered up 
and sapped you when you weren't looking.

After a moment your head clears and you find that it was all a dream.  A 
wonderful, wonderful dream, at least compared to waking up as an 
all-but-dissertation adjunct faculty member at Enormous State University with a 
stack of student papers to grade, a thesis left unfinished and at least 46 more 
resumes to send out before the break.  You lift your head from the bent and 
discolored industrial steel desk ("ES prison system model #23-c") to find that 
you've drooled all over the student paper that you were grading.
 
Your Office
Your office.  It was once held mice for the biology department, but a campus 
committee determined that under various federal regulations and Sec 6B-34-1-c 
of the faculty and staff handbook that the lighting, ventilation and electrical 
subsystems were inadequate for animal habitation.  They are perfectly adequate 
to store adjuncts, however, even if a slight smell of rodent urine permeates 
the air.  There is an exit to the west and a window in the wall.

You can see a Thesis, a Final Exam and a Computer here.

>I don't understand you.  Perhaps you'd like to play "fingertips:  I don't

your legs, the pain in your lungs and make it.  A split second later, the owner

could pass for a kitchen. There's a refrigerator magnet on it.

There's a wall cell phone here--you know, the sort that still needs to be

there is nothing to do. "No, no, no. That doesn't SHOW anything." The director

okay, don't get too high or low. It's a start. Don't be afraid to mess up. We 
just need ideas now. Once we get enough, we can put em through focus groups and 
then we can decide which ones are best. Maybe we can reformulate your ideas for

Summer on a college campus is rarely exciting, and this year is no exception. 
Your fellow students won't be returning for three more weeks, and the endless 
grind of your job at the computer center is not anyone's idea of entertainment.

Yesterday was the first of September, and autumn is moving in. But the long 
drag of classes won't start for weeks. Restless would be one way to describe 
your mood; bored sick would be another.

Last night, you had odd dreams: a circle, turning endlessly, and carrying you 
on its back across strange lands; yourself grown double, and dueling with 
cold-blazing swords; and others, stranger yet.

Then the alarm went off, and you emerged into another mundane day. Maybe 
something will come along to entertain you....

The hair on your legs stands on end, your throat goes dry. You sense a 
presence, like a dog smells another dog. There is someone else on the balcony, 
in the dark corner by the balustrade. A spy? A prowler? But the wall is 
impossible to climb. Not a person then, but a demon. Baal-Zevuv? It steps out 
of the dark. A shudder of relief runs along your extremities as you recognise 
your dead father.

Balcony
The night is lit with stars and flashes of distant artillery fire. An 
unseasonably cool breeze rubs against your naked calves. Light sifts from your 
bedroom to the west.

Your dead father stands before you.

>no
You hold a silent conversation with yourself, for no one else seems able to 
answer the questions that gnaw at your soul.

- My little dear one, something is rotten in the House of Pudlo. -

His voice rings somehow out of synch with the movements of his mouth and jaw. 
The impression of artificiality is reinforced by his unblinking eyes in which 
you see your miniature reflection, as if looking in the reversed end of a 
telescope.

- You must revenge my foul and most unnatural murder! -

- Murder? - you exclaim. He beckons you to silence. - Yes, my dear boy, that 
shameless, that adulterate beast known to you as "Mother" has murdered me in 
connivance with Jacek, with whom she has been indulging in fornication since 
Shabbat Shekalim. -

>n
Your father indicates that he wishes you to hear him out.

- The Babylonian Whore - he continues, flecks of foam appearing in the corners 
of his mouth - had applied a poisonous ointment to the sides of my chamber-pot. 
With a consuming rash, the poison scaled the delicate skin of my derrire and 
curdled my blood. The vile nature of the resulting concoction can not be 
described, so vile it was, only alluded to, and that only by comparing it to a 
mixture of red wine and sour milk.-

With his arms raised in a theatrical gesture, as if summoning the stars to bear 
witness, he exclaims:

- O, Adonai Hashem, be not silent! She has spoken to me with lying tongues and 
repaid me evil for good and hatred for love. Raise up a vengeful angel and let 
it tear out her eyes and heart so that her shrieks may untie the knot of evil 
and close up her filthy cunt! -

The vehement gesture raises the hem of his shirt giving you an unsolicited 
glimpse of his hair-darkened buttocks. Realising the unseemliness of his new 
stance, he resumes the bending posture and (clasping his hands on his genitals) 
faces you anew.

>take
(the apparition)
He is not a man to be trifled with.

- The balances of good and evil are askew. - Your father lifts one hand from 
his crotch and, speaking in a calm but forceful tone, begins to tap emphasis on 
the railing with a bony finger. - Unless the beast redeems her wicked deed with 
her life, I will be doomed for eternity to walk the night in this unseemly 
apparel. You do not have to kill Jacek. Your mother was no doubt the driving 
force behind my untimely demise. Such a perfidious plot could have taken root 
only in the fiendish mind of a she-devil. - The tapping stops. - Besides, are 
Jacek's wife and children not punishment enough? - His lips curl into a 
spiteful smile.

- Before you dispose of her - he continues - you must bring me a book. Although 
she has no conception of its true power, she may at least have some idea of 
what this book can do in the right hands. -

His pace quickens, as if he were out of breath.

- I can not venture into details. You must bring it before tonight becomes 
tomorrow. I will be waiting in the park, by Mickiewicz. -

A pause. - There is one more thing... - The sentence is never finished. A horn 
clamours out of the darkness, harsh and urgent, a hunter calling lost hounds. 
Turning your head in the direction of the sound, you stare into blackness. When 
you look back at your father, he is no longer there.

Balcony
You clutch the railing with white knuckles. Your breath is visible as steam. It 
whirls and sways in the westward breeze, floating in the direction of your 
bedroom. The night is lit with stars and flashes of distant artillery fire.

The tour had been going exceedingly well up to this point. You've always 
yearned to visit a Ghost Town and your affection for the Old West has never 
been stronger. It stemmed from your early years of playing Cowboys and Indians 
with the neighborhood gang. When the opportunity came up, this was a no-miss 
trip! A remote town on the old Texas-Mexico border that has been left untouched 
and well-preserved in the arid climate for more than a century. This is exactly 
the vacation that you have craved! At one time, this place was a bustling 
little frontier town of notable repute. Nameless now, the town was once filled 
with frontiersmen. "Gauchos" the underpaid South American tour guide kept 
calling them. Cowboys by any other name. It doesn't matter what nationality a 
cowboy is, he remains an icon and a legend. You couldn't wait to get here - 
when you logged out of the Geek and set your Facebook status to 'On Vacation', 
you were going totally tech-free, just like the pioneers did. Even more special 
is that this particular no-name town was founded by none other than General 
Jebbidiah Alden in 1865. A Civil War hero who made it his mission in life to 
help rebuild after the destruction caused by the war. General Alden was 
well-liked and well-respected. History remembers him kindly. His descendants 
still live only a few hundred miles from the site of this now long-abandoned 
ghost town. Unfortunately, your allergies have kicked in at the worst possible 
time. Before long the tour guide was speaking but all you could concentrate on 
was the stuffiness in your head. Breathing became a labor and staying alert a 
chore. If you could just rest your head for a few minutes... It wasn't exactly 
clear when you fell asleep, but the tour guide and your fellow tourists have 
moved on without you. The last thing you can remember is the tour guide saying 
that the group could take a short break for lunch, take a last look around and 
then get back on the bus for the trip home. As you wake up, you can hear the 
clunker of a bus pull out of the parking lot to the north. 

Welcome to Gaucho! Your goal is to survive one (1) night here in this ghost 
town so you can be picked up by the next tour bus that will arrive in the 
morning. With your allergies acting up, you'll need a good night's sleep to 
make it through. And you are so thirsty that you'll never be able to sleep 
without a good long chug of water. To survive in this old frontier town, you 
will need all of your wits to combat puzzles and obstacles that stand in your 
way. As you progress, you will uncover various special items and, quite 
possibly, some gold. At the end of your adventure (if you either Win or Quit), 
you will be given a unique code that you can use on the Geek to claim special 
microbadges and geekgold. At any time during the game, you can type SCORE to 
see your progress. If you wish to give up and simply claim your earned prizes, 
you can type QUIT. If you win the game, it will be obvious as to how to claim 
your prizes. The maximum score for this game is 100. If you need a bit of 
generic help, type HELP. Good luck!

Secluded Alley
You are standing in a secluded alley. The sun is mostly shielded by the 
buildings to either side and to the south. To the north, you see the road and 
parking lot where the bus had previously been. Behind you is a thick wall, with 
a nice soft pile of dirt to nap on. But now that the wind is picking up, 
blowing straight into the alley, you doubt that you'd be able to sleep there 
anymore!

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

You amble your way to the north.

Old Post Road
A wide, dusty road stretches east and west here, punctuated only by a few 
cracks in the dry earth. Decrepit buildings - few safe to enter after their 
many years of decay - line both sides of the street. To the north is the 
parking lot where the Wavemotion Tour Bus deposited you just a couple of hours 
ago - now empty, with a pair of tire marks stretching across the hard-packed 
ground back to the highway. Directly to the south is the secluded alley where 
you rested.

A large dark wooden wagon wheel, about three feet across, rests against a 
hitching post. The wood looks solid enough, though a few of the spokes show 
some cracks.

You were celebrating the arrival of the not-quite-second-half of the 21st 
century with your buddies in your gaming basement when the bad news arrived: 
Crazy Uncle Scott had finally given up the good fight and passed off into 
gaming nirvana. He was an unusual man, with a firm belief that the world went 
to hell in a hand-basket with the arrival of text messages, always claiming 
that their phones were smarter than them! So he bought himself a huge mansion 
and spent his last days there pining for the glory days of yore, when websites 
were nothing more than acres of bright blue links thrown willy-nilly onto a 
computer screen.

Somehow, though, he took a shine to you, and you were smart enough to hide your 
smartphone whenever he came calling. Nevertheless, it was quite a surprise to 
learn that he left you exactly half his will. And even more of a surprise to 
discover that the lawyer's language was precise: not half his massive fortune 
in Geekgold, but literally half his will. Along with a short note explaining 
that to collect your full inheritance, you must retrieve the second half of 
Crazy Uncle Scott's will from his old estate, Alden Manor. The very name brings 
chills to your spine: that place is haunted!

But the true horror lay in the closing passage of the note:
Leave your Smartphone at home!

Fly as thick as driving rain;
And ever again, in the wink of an eye, 
Painted stations whistle by."

With lights blazing, the midnight express thunders through the night. On silver 
moonlit track it races clear. Its mournful steam whistle sounds across a 
sleeping countryside.

We are carried at speed, in sumptuous first class comfort, past a sleeping 
village, then beyond through the opening of a tunnel, and out into the open 
again.

The steam engine "Bluebell," races fast and clear through falling snow. Through 
dark and gloomy woods, over a bridge and on into the night.

A First Class Carriage
You are on your way home to spend Christmas with your family, and what a 
splendid start to the holiday. A first class train ride, from the cold winters 
fog of London, to the clean air of the family home in Torquay.

Sitting in the carriage, across the table from you is Ingrid. Ingrid is your 
closest friend and is to spend the Christmas holiday with you.

This first class coach is alive with Christmas spirit; from the excited 
conversation of your fellow travellers, to the brightly coloured Christmas 
presents they have in their luggage. The carriage itself is full of sumptuous 
detail. High back, plush ruby red seating. Golden oak tables, and decorated 
wall panels. All lit by the orange flame of brass oil lamps.

Outside the windows, deep dark woods rush past.

On the table is a newspaper.

Well, this is it. Two years of chef school, five of apprenticeship, a lifetime 
of good taste and now, a week after the grand opening of your first five-star 
restaurant, an anonymous tipster has told you that Vera Davenport, the most 
important living culinary reviewer, has chosen this afternoon to critique your 
establishment. You make a quick mental readiness check and decide that, all in 
all, things couldn't be worse.

A rash of sickness and bad excuses has decimated your evening staff, and you 
have a huge entre shortage due to some problems with your food supplier. 
Though Mrs. Davenport clearly remembers the 1940s, you've heard that she 
doesn't like theme restaurants, so you're not sure how she'll take to the big 
band, or the pneumatic tube food delivery system, or any of the other war-era 
memorabilia that decorate Mack n' Geez, your magnum opus and life's dream since 
cooking school graduation.

You seat a wealthy family of four at table one and hurry off to do a once-over 
around the restaurant. As the father shouts for a glass of wine, you reflect 
that if you can just make it through the night and somehow squeeze a good 
review out of Vera Davenport, Mack n' Geez might just stay in business.

Kitchen
The kitchen of your eatery is expansive and well-organized. A large oven and 
rangetop with an adjacent counter fill up one side of the room, next to the 
pneumatic tube station and a row of hanging utensils. Above the oven are 
several fishtanks for your fresh seafood. Rows of cupboards and an ugly glass 
cabinet line the remaining walls, along with an industrial dishwasher, a 
refrigerator, and a large sink. Actually, when you break it all down it starts 
to feel a bit cramped in here.

A small doorway north to your office is half-hidden behind the fridge. A set of 
swinging double doors lead east to the seating area, a back door west to an 
alley, and an iron-wrought spiral staircase leads down to the wine cellar.

Your Office
You had rather intended to leave a bit more room for your owner's office, but 
what with one thing and another and the stove measurements being in metric, not 
that anyone should bother to tell you, it turned out to be more of a closet. A 
small desk overflowing with supply orders, zoning paperwork, invoices, and 
recipes occupies about eighty percent of the available space, along with a tiny 
wooden chair. A cordless phone hangs on the wall.

The only way out of here is back south to the kitchen, although you 
occasionally find yourself wishing for an escape hatch of some sort.

Working for Apex Lair Security Services, you've met all kinds of interesting 
people. As a matter of fact, Ornomir the Deathlord doesn't sound much different 
from several other clients whose treasure-laden underground lairs you've 
guarded in the past. He's richer than most of them, however, and very 
influential; Ornomir carries a lot of weight in the wealthy subterranean-comp
lex-owning community. Do this job well, and if Ornomir puts in a good word for 
you it could mean a big promotion. On the other hand, mess things up and you 
can probably kiss your position good-bye. If there's one job that's important 
to your career, this is it.

Then again, if Ornomir's so rich and so concerned about his treasures, he 
probably has all sorts of safeguards already in place to protect them, so you 
shouldn't have anything to worry about. Anyway, thinking too much about the 
potential consequences is only going to give you a headache; best to think 
about this is just another job and do your usual thorough work.

So, after an uneventful journey, you arrive at Ornomir's door, ready for 
another relatively uneventful night of...

Outside Ornomir's Lair
You are just outside the main door to the lair of the deathlord Ornomir, 
standing on a nearly invisible, earth-covered path on a steep mountainside, 
which slopes away to a green valley far below, through which you can barely see 
a winding river, brown with mud.

The main door to Ornomir's lair is to the east, so seamlessly camouflaged with 
the surrounding mountainside that you would never have noticed it if you hadn't 
already known it was there.

Life on Gue Street.

I highly suggest typing "About" if this is your first time playing this.

The little, invaluable self-deceptions we allow ourselves. Sometimes they're 
the only things that make adventuring bearable. Today, for example, you're 
taking a walk on Gue Street beneath a cloudless summer sky. Not surprising; 
you've been adventuring around this neighborhood almost every day to enjoy the 
warm weather and plentiful treasure. You've walked down this street, and dozens 
identical to it all across Quendor, countless times, reveling in the little 
details, taking an adventurer's pleasure in noting how the whole architecture 
of the game seems to change based on what you type. The placement of a single 
"N" or "Kill Troll" or the calibrated timing of a child's laugh, the most 
random of events, combine like a catalyst with your emotions such that the 
street never appears quite the same. It is therefore completely plausible, you 
tell yourself repeatedly, that this is just another daily adventure, that 
there's no special reason why you turned down this tiny lane rather than the 
next one. The fact that the White House, the unjustly enticing old, boarded up, 
cozy, bungalow is just down the street is a mere coincidence, nothing more.

 Type "1" to continue, "2" to turn back, or "No" to take a different path.

 Type "1" to continue, "2" to turn back, or "No" to take a different path.
no

You walk around the White House and let yourself in through an open window. A 
quick walk into the living room reveals a sword of apparent Elvish origin, and 
a great lamp. This walk on Gue street, which started out so introspectively, 
may already be paying off. In an contemplative mood, you examine the oriental 
rug in the living room to make sure it isn't the product of child labor. In 
doing so, while remembering your many adventures past, you discover a trap 
door. You are a self-respecting adventurer, despite what Pat said, so you open 
it and descend.

Your looking for a job. 'Boss' as you know him as, picked you up one day and 
asked you if you wanted one. It was about murder, and you were scared at first,

It is the hottest summer of all time (or at least it feels that way now that 
your electricity has been cut off). Your lack of employment has finally caught 
up with you. Your funds have been depleted and your pockets are empty. Last 
month's essentials (cable television and Internet access) are now but sweet 
memories. The lack of air conditioning feels like the final straw. You were 
really hoping to starve to death at a comfortable 68 degrees.

Yesterday for lunch you boiled and ate two hot dog wieners. For dinner, you 
drank the water you boiled them in. (Mmm, "Hot Dog Soup".) So far your dignity 
has kept you from rummaging through trash cans for food, but it's starting to 
sound like a viable option. Just the thought of sinking your teeth into someone 
else's left over pizza crust makes your mouth water.

The current economy has made it hell for a spoiled, out-of-work computer 
programmer such as yourself to find work.  It wasn't too long ago that a 
five-figure salary seemed beneath you; today, given your current state of 
affairs, you would accept four. It's time to find a job and find some food, and 
find them today.

Living Room
While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back when you 
were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place up. Now that you 
have all the time in the world, you have no money. Even in hard times, you 
retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch sits along one wall, facing your 
cheap (and empty) entertainment center. The front door of your home is to the 
NORTH. Your dining room lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.

(First time playing Hangar 22? Type ABOUT. Need a list of common commands? Type 
COMMANDS.)

Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming in, and 
vice versa (it's called physics).

You can also see a couch, a fish bowl, an entertainment center and a coffee 
table (on which is a remote control) here.

You can't, since the front door is in the way.

Before the front gate
Well, you can understand why Uncle Steve certainly doesn't get a lot of 
visitors.  The path here is little more than a dirt track, with weeds and 
overgrown bushes crowding it from both sides.  And the view is less than 
stellar, the museum looming over you keeps bringing to mind words like "gloom" 
and "doom" and other words ending in "oom".

An ominious looking black iron gate bars the way north.

"This is the house, miss," the man from the town says, stopping a good few 
yards from the gate. Even as you thank him, he is walking briskly away - 
shoulders hunched, hands in pockets - and he does not turn around to answer 
you. 

 You peer through the wrought-iron curlicues of the gate and wonder if there 
has been some mistake. This house hardly looks inhabited. All its windows are 
dark. Its paint, whatever color it once was, has faded to a dull greyish shade. 
The posts of the porch railing are broken and jagged, leaning at odd angles 
like a mouthful of crooked teeth. Can this really be the home of your new 
employer? 

 Well, you should at least go up to the house and look. You've come all this 
way, after all. 

 You step through the gate. It creaks shut behind you.

Front Lawn
The tall, browning grass rustles in the chill wind, but there don't seem to be 
any flowers to bring a bit of color to the grey surroundings. A cobbled path 
cuts a narrow slice through the overgrown lawn, leading north to the house, and 
another path, branching off of that one, leads around the side of the house to 
the northwest. To the south looms the front gate.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

Porch
The old boards of the porch seem to give a little under your feet. To the 
south, a set of creaking steps leads down to the overgrown, tangled expanse of 
the lawn; to the north is the front door of the house.

CHAPTER ONE: HAPPY FAMILY

Wet, tired and incredibly bored.

That just about sums up your present frame of mind. Standing in an almost empty 
churchyard in a ghostly nondescript town, all the while being soaked by 
constant rainfall, would be bad enough at the best of times.

What makes it even worse is the very fact you're here. An all too often 
forgotten niece at her uncle's funeral. You're starting to wish you hadn't made 
the long journey up north after all. It's not like Uncle Henry actually cared 
about anything except his money and his ego, and you just wish the priest would 
get on with this tiresome ceremony.

After it's finished you could go home, emptying any lingering thoughts of the 
selfish, arrogant man from your mind.

Graveyard
Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many gravestones and 
the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend in perfectly with the 
sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the south, with the promise of 
relatively safe territory beyond, can't begin to neutralise their gloomy 
surroundings.

Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

A group of mourners are gathered around the latest addition to the cemetery. 
The parish priest stands nearby, reading the last rites at a painfully slow 
pace.

>That was a rhetorical question.

The priest pauses for a moment before continuing with his speech.

"There are those of us who are misguided in life, those who seek to inflict 
pain on others in order to further their own desires. Henry Lambert was one 
such person."

>No matter what you might think of your uncle, it would hardly be respectful to 
leave before the end of the proceedings.

Almost as if in reaction to the priest's condemnation it starts to rain 
slightly heavier. The crowd of people seems to be growing tired of the sermon 
and seeing the rapidly declining interest of those present, the priest seeks to 
bring the proceedings to a swift conclusion.

"May he be forgiven for his sins, and may he find peace and solitude in a 
better world."

As the sun sets on the plains, Sheriff Cheney angrily snaps on the cuffs. You 
are shoved into the coach and land on top of Muddy Charlie and a pile of silver 
dollars, which until recently had been the property of the Missouri, Kansas & 
Texas Line.

Muddy whispers, "Don't fret none, Rick! You done good blowing up that tunnel -- 
I just didn't plan on the sheriff getting word ahead of time, is all. That were 
powerful bad luck."

The sheriff climbs onto his horse, spits, and you begin to rumble forward. "You 
boys really got it coming this time," he yells back cheerfully.

Muddy shakes his head. "No offense, Sheriff, but I reckon you got the wrong 
men. We was just on our way to the theater."

The sheriff disagrees. "The only place you boys are heading is straight to

Type "help" for instructions and "hints" for hints -- or just roll into town 
guns a-blazin'.

[Press Space To Continue]In the twilight, you sight the sheriff's sturdy brick office near the edge of 
town. "That's mighty fine construction," notes Muddy, sounding less feisty now. 
"Mighty fine indeed." The coach rolls to a halt and a thick arm yanks you 
roughly from your seat. You land awkwardly in the rutted street, where the 
sheriff holds you in place with the heel of one boot. He yells to his men, 
"Bring the coach around back, we got to impound that evidence." You are shoved 
into the sheriff's office and then into a small holding cell.

The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and stands, 
tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a brief, 
judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on the desk. He 
barks, "Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near the train. A federal 
marshal will be coming for them at eight o'clock tomorrow morning. There's 
going to be a hanging!" The deputy nods slowly. The sheriff continues, "Please 
take care of our 'guests'. I got to head down to Wichita Falls to discuss my 
invention with some investors, so you is in charge." The deputy smiles until 
the sheriff adds, "Jimbo, don't screw up," as he heads out the door.

Jail Cell
Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow after 
another one of Muddy's dubious plans? Will you ever learn? How did it come to 
this? 

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a 
tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. 
Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's office.

A broken stool lies on the floor.

Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on 
a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the jail 
bars.

In the office you can also see the deputy.

>That was a rhetorical question.

On the other side of the jail bars in the office, the deputy runs his hand 
through his sparse hair. 

>You can't go that way.

Over in the office, the deputy pokes his head out of the office and yells at 
some passersby. 

>(Muddy)
I don't reckon Muddy would much care for that.

In the office, the deputy sniffles loudly and wipes his nose on his sleeve.

>about
"This game was conceived of and fully outlined in early June of 1999."

And it was, too. All that discussion of compassless games, and mazes, and 
whether "Hunt the Wumpus" was really IF, made me giggle. I already had this on 
the drawing board. I didn't start any of that discussion, either -- although I 
contributed a few comments that I knew would turn out relevant.

Hunter, in Darkness came in eighth in the 1999 Interactive Fiction Competition. 
I might perhaps have done better if I'd included a walkthrough, or hints. Never 
know now, eh?

I'm not including hints now, because this is no longer a Competition game. 
Different strictures apply. You can easily find a walkthrough, or ask for help. 
However, I will say this:

No serious mapping is necessary, or even useful, in playing this game. If you 
think you need to start drawing a map, you're wrong.

"I'm sorry, Mother. I know this isn't the career you wanted for me. But it's 
something I believe in. I consider it a great opportunity and one I can't pass 
up."

A silver-haired woman in her later years stands before you with her hands 
shaking and her eyes in tears. "I know, Jake. I know. You've always made good 
decisions, and I'm proud of you no matter what. It's just... so very dangerous. 
I'm worried. Why did you have to sign on with... with..."

You reach out in a feeble attempt to comfort your mother, but the vision fades 
as it always does in this dream. Never a second opportunity, never another 
chance to make things right before...

"Breeeeet... Breeeeet... Level 5 Emergency... Level 5 Emergency. Cryogenic pods 
activated. Hull Temperature now at critical. Guidance System damaged. Main 
Deflectors destroyed. Descent proceeding on last known trajectory..."

Your hearing is always the first to respond after waking from cryogenic 
hibernation. A few seconds later the other senses begin to thaw and your eyes 
regain some level of focus. Normally the first thing you would see is the soft 
glow of the overhead cabin lights. This time, however, your senses are greeted 
by unfamiliar and harsh stimuli. The tremendous light and heat, bearing down 
with the intensity of a hundred suns, don't allow your eyes to open for more 
than an instant. The grating noise all around you builds to a fevered pitch as 
it drowns out the automated warnings.

A few seconds later comes a thunderous boom, followed by darkness, and finally 
silence.

When you regain consciousness you are in possession of the single worst 
headache you can remember. Granted, this is the only headache you can remember 
having. Other than the bump on your head, you can vaguely remember a dream of 
your mother... and very little else...

I didn't take it seriously when the wretched old woman read my fortune and told 
me I would die on this date. Why should I have? 

Just because she's been right about everything else? 

But it is different now. Because it turns out it's not just me, it's everyone.  
Like the banner above the window says: 

WELCOME TO THE END OF THE WORLD. 

The prophecies have come true, one by one.  The earthquakes, the eruptions, the 
sun turning red. And they've accelerated; the final three all came yesterday, 
so there is no denying it. Even the most skeptical today are mute, with leaden

But even in my last hours, or perhaps last minutes, I am not scared. I will

You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't 
believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence 
instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual 
shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on 
you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least 
Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had 
the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get

You've always been an outsider. At school, being interested in science, the 
other students didn't want to have anything to do with you. The other boys 
laughed at you, the girls despised you. Your parents didn't understand you. And 
even your teachers were so far below your intellectual level that you couldn't 
have a serious conversation with them! This went so far that you always got bad 
grades, although you were smarter than everybody else - your stupid teachers 
simply never saw it.

Now, after years of restless private scientific research, you've finally 
achieved your goal: You've found the secret of invisibility. Everyone at work 
(you don't know any people outside work) said you were mad when you announced 
your plans... especially your boss who just laughed and said a lowly research 
assistant working at a second-rate university would never be able to do it. He 
only hired you to do the most stupid, repetitive and primitive of work, after 
all. Most of the day, you're forced to clean test tubes. Nobody has ever 
recognised your genius! Now you've proven them all wrong - and you'll have your 
revenge on them! Yes, revenge... the only thing you can think of right now.

you anyway, but if someone had, he or she certainly wouldn't have gotten to see

Endless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, 
tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you

A Galactic servant, that's what you feel like at the moment.  You'd think that 
the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for 
discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were 
instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their 
gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on 
Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's 
gratitude for you.

However, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but 
to do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for 
Karn, but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for 
Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much 
for Gallifreyan hospitality...

Your thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.  The TARDIS has 
landed on Karn.

Doctor Proctor Phillips has been bothering the world for quite a long time now.

First came the infamous Rabbits' Attacks, then the Tortoise Kamikadzes, and 
after that - The Mouse Terrorists...

Everyone agreed something had to be done about it, but no-one knew what - 
that's where you came in.

You, Anthony Amerbach, one of the most extravagant agents the world had ever 
known. You don't have the charisma of James Bond or even the humour of Nick 
Pirandello, in fact, you look as ugly as ten drunken goblins and speak like 
someone who just inhaled too much cocaine.

But you do have one strength - you love the extraordinary... And this Proctor 
turned out to be the most extraordinary guy FBI has ever faced (much worse than 
the infamous cannibalistic doctor).

So you were told to go to Proctor's secret hideout... Surprisingly enough, you 
not only found out its location in a pretty ordinary Chinese atlas (sold only 
in Krasnoyarsk), you also got there without much problems (ten battleships and 
five submarines shooting torpedoes don't count).

                       [Please press SPACE to continue.]

Running down a long featureless white corridor not knowing from who or what you 
experience a great sense of urgency and panic. Dressed in nothing but a white 
hospital robe, a shudder runs down your spine as you feel thin fingers reaching 
out to grab you. A voice calls out, "You have one minute to reach minimum safe 
distance," followed by the distant sound of an explosion.

You round a corner and stop short. Panic rises in your heart as you face a 
horrible drooling man wielding an axe. Before you can turn to flee he dissolves 
into another man clad in a white doctor's coat and wearing a stethoscope around 
his neck. He speaks a word that sounds like, "Spivey."  He suddenly lunges for 
you! You turn to flee...

No longer in the featureless hallway, you find yourself in some kind of 
laboratory. The hum of great machinery is all around you. An odd sensation near 
your head makes you realize that your hair has grown long and stringy. An itchy 
sensation in your chest catches your attention and you discover that you are no 
longer wearing the white robe. Instead you are attired in a turtle neck sweater 
and bell bottoms. A nearby terminal beeps an alarm. Reams of ticker tape begin 
to spew output onto the floor. The Program some how feels familiar.

A noise from behind you catches your attention. Two men dressed in dark suits 
and glasses enter the room. An ominous and hunched shadow looms in the doorway 
behind them lurking on the edge of sight. The sense of fear and urgency 
returns. The men draw guns from within their coats. You have nowhere to run...

                                     -BANG-

You sit up in your bed. Your eyes refuse to focus on the great commotion about 
you. Someone calls your name. Someone else has kicked your door in. Three

John And Your's Room (on the floor)
You share this double room with your good friend John. A window, which has a 
nice view of the campus arts center and two dressers are the only notable 
furnishings of the room other than the two identical single beds. A door, 
hanging from its broken hinges provides passageway between this room and the 
common room to the south. A small but adequate walk-in closet lies to the east.

A Final Thought.

Day and night I feverishly worked upon the machine, creating both a soul which 
could desire its goal, and a body with which it could realize it. Many who saw 
my creation called it an abomination, and denied me grant money. But they could 
not dissuade me from my impossible task. It was a spectre that tormented me 
always, a ghost I had to give a form and a life, lest it consume me from the 
inside. And when at last my task was done, when the grey box on wheels was 
complete and when it, as well as I, knew what had to be done, I felt deep 
sympathy for the machine. For I had not destroyed the phantom, but merely 
exorcized it into another body. The robot knew not why this task had to be 
performed, for I could not imbue it with knowledge I did not myself posess. And 
at the same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep over me, that 
somehow, the dream that had driven me for my entire life had come one step 
closer to fruition.

"Gort, Klaatu Verada Nikto"

As I vocally activated the robot, I realized that it was following my 
instructions, but not out of any desire to obey me. Had I remained silent, it 
would have performed exactly the same operations. We were two beings controlled 
by the same force now. And yet, seeking vainly to hold some illusion of control 
over the machine I thought I had created, I gave my final command.

"GO!"  I told the box as it began to roll out of my workshop into the frozen 
desert beyond. "FIND KITTEN!"

Nobody told you stardom would be this boring. You thought the five-year wait 
just to get into the sky was bad, but at least you had an earth to occupy 
yourself with, humans doddering around like flies - rather amusing flies. You 
haven't seen humans on the moon in forever. You've seen nothing, in fact, but 
the same dull rocks in the same musty craters, and the stars who made it to the 
sky saying don't worry, it'll be your turn soon, everyone gets their chance, 
stay pretty, you should really shine more.

You have to admit, though, he was right. Your turn came. A leap second, your 
time to plunge off this rock into their sky, stop clocks, fulfill a few wishes 
if you must, and dazzle everyone who watches - that, or miss the landing and 
live the rest of your life swaddled by a cold ocean. Your debut: all the stars 
do it.

The sky is cold. Midnight is soon. Leap time.

someone down below were to look at the sky when you were out of your trench, 
they'd merely see a shiny speck. Windows get them all the time. Nothing to

You are awake, but you would rather not be.  The severe cramp in your neck 
seems almost inconsequential in comparison with the pounding in your head.  
Your suspicions are roused as to what may have happened the previous night 
because, as yet, you can remember nothing.  A peculiarly furry sensation in 
your mouth, combined with the unmistakable stench of very cheap scotch, adds to 
your mounting fear.

By the time your vision clears and you notice that you are lying in the bath of 
your friend's hall of residence, it is clear to you that you are a victim of 
Jessica's 21st Birthday Party, as advertised on lamp posts and fences across 
the city for the past three months.

Your liver is reporting major difficulties and your stomach produces 
intermittent gurgles of protest.  Your head drowns out all other 
considerations, however, and you sit up, take a look around you, and pray for 
death...

The narrow, dingy bathroom of Scummett block is furnished with a bath and a 
toilet.  The wallpaper peels miserably, as though - knowing from the first that 
it was doomed to languish in a humid cesspit - it could never quite summon the 
motivation to stand upright.  The stippled glass on this shady side of the 
building admits little light, but the door leading south into the corridor is 
outlined in faint brightness.

The warm summer rain paints a pattern on the vespertine pavements of Rome. I'm 
in my shower while large drops of rain aggressively knock against the window, 
just to join with their siblings to form a rill.

I think of them. Each of them was so special. The delicate fingers pressing 
against the indestructible window pane which was supposed to keep evil out. The 
superior attitude suddenly giving way to despair. The widening eyes in the 
moment of cognition. I step out of the shower and let go of the memory. My 
mouth line is twisted into a bitter smile. My skin is dry.

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That 
means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, 
and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl 
around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. 
Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who 
confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to 
stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their 
elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his 
legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

stone steps lead up to the front door. A gravel path runs round the sides of 
the house to east and west.

The sniveling, weak and simple-minded crypt things that make up the board of 
deans at Hoover rejected your application with an air of snotty disdain. These 
aged -- and afraid! -- old men couldn't bear, for a moment, to think outside 
the box and consider your request to study Unnatural Mystic Phenomenon as 
completely valid. 

It took almost a month of cajoling, phoning and begging, but you finally got 
the lot of them together in one room so that you could plead your case in 
person. You recall how difficult it was, years ago, to get together the 
required cast for your PhD review at Syracuse, and it only increases the fury 
and contempt you have for the liverspotted trots before you today.

You will get your approval. You will complete your studies here in the desert, 
flanked by continually imported human decadence, the comforting warmth of the 
sun and, of course, easy showgirls. Or else you will be the end of these 
miserable, cowardly, academic dinosaurs!

East Wing Conference Room
Before you are the department heads to the different University factions you 
could scare up. Clack, the dean of mathematics; Schmidt, the dean of languages; 
VanBeaugard, the dean of history; Snell, the dean of sciences and Lee, the dean 
of religion and mythology. Headmaster Yeboeha is also here, although you don't 
remember asking for the pleasure of his company. The deans fidget about, 
probably thinking of just how to phrase the cruel insults they will eventually 
attack you with.

>no

Exactly.

>n
You can't go that way.

Suddenly, the door leading out of the Hall opens. An absolutely gorgeous young 
woman -- surely no older than nineteen -- dressed in a provocative cocktail 
dress enters the room pushing a large cart. Atop the cart is a covered silver 
pan.

"Happy Birthday!" she exclaims. She comes up to Clack and gives his 
geezergenarian cheek a wet kiss. Everyone except Lee and yourself clap and 
hoot. The girl removes the top of the pan revealing a large chocolate and 
vanilla birthday cake.

>take
(the pillcase)
You already have that.

The girl cuts the cake up into several smaller squares. She deftly maneuvers 
her body away from that of Clack who is apparently attempting to pinch her 
behind, to the delight of the rest of the deans (again, excepting Lee).

It took you a little time to get your vampire costume together, so you've been 
running late for Gary's costume party.  You've arrived now on the ground floor 
of his high-rise apartment building.  Better late than never as they say.  

The elevator makes a soft jingle as it opens and you step into the mirrored 
interior.  For a moment you think, struggling to remember Gary's floor 
number...  Oh yes, you remember now, 15.  You reach out and push the 
appropriate button.  The doors begin to close but stop suddenly as a slender 
hand appears.  There's another jingle and the doors open again revealing a 
beautiful, red-headed girl dressed in a toga.  

You recognize her from campus although you do not actually know her.  For a 
moment you almost do not see the red rubber snakes entwined with her long red 
curls.  She steps into the elevator and reaches for a button, but stops, 
apparently seeing that it is already lit.  

It seems, you think as the doors close and the elevator begins to move, that 
this "Medusa" is going to same costume party that you are.

Elevator
An elevator; pretty much like any other elevator you've ever been in. Your 
increased weight conveys the sensation of movement and the floor indicator 
above the closed doors changes as the elevator passes floors. Next to the 
elevator doors, several dozen buttons are arranged in two rows.

All the walls in this elevator are mirrored and exhibit a matrix of identical 
vampires and gorgons stretching to infinity in all directions.

A slender, red headed girl dressed as Medusa stands beside you.  Her 
reflections surround you in all directions.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

The girl smiles at you. "I've always been fascinated with Greek mythology." She 
glances at her reflection in the mirror. "My room mate helped me make this.  
She's a theatrical major and gets a lot of experience working with costumes.  I 
understand her professor is a little on the cheap side so they often just have 
to make do."

That rings true to your ears, having taken some creative arts classes before.

>tell girl about Dracula costume
"Dracula was always my favorite monster," you say, glancing at one of your many 
reflections.

"I used to stay up late at night and watch vampire shows with my father when I 
was a little girl.  At least I did when he wasn't working."

You grimace. "Not exactly Sesame Street."

She shrugs.  "It's true.  I was too young to be watching those kinds of shows.  
Vampires scare me even today."

>ask girl about costume
"I like your costume," You say, conscious of how lame you sound.

The girl smiles at you. "I've always been fascinated with Greek mythology." She 
glances at her reflection in the mirror. "My room mate helped me make this.  
She's a theatrical major and gets a lot of experience working with costumes.  I 
understand her professor is a little on the cheap side so they often just have 
to make do."

That rings true to your ears, having taken some creative arts classes before.

>uit
That's not a verb I recognize.

>tell girl about mummies
"Mummies always scared me."

A look of mock concern comes across her face. "That's sad," she says. "It's 
okay to be scared of monsters, but no child should be scared of mommies."

You start to shake your head at her misunderstanding but see her smile and 
realize she was joking.

"So what other things scare you?" she asks.

>ask girl about father
"What does he do?  Your father, I mean."

"I'm not all that sure to be honest.  Something with computers, I think."

You nod. "I hear some people think those things have potential."

She giggles.

You wake to stillness.  The hammering, banging, and shouting that kept you 
awake half the night are gone.  The air is cold, and something smells burnt.  
Your master's experiments must be finished, but with what result?

Something hesitates on the edge of your consciousness, the memory of unquiet 
dreams...

Then you see.  You have been sent, again.  The taste of ash is on your lips, 
the grit in your eyes.  And you blink...

This is your home. A small cottage that you built for you and your daughter. 
Made from the wood of the surrounding trees, it blends in very well with the

digital cell. Normally the Kaden would already be at work analyzing your mind 
to run the loyalty transfer program, but you haven't felt anything at all in 
the last five hours. The delay is unnerving, since the mind can survive in 
virtual space for a limited amount of time before it destroys itself. Your

since they know nothing of your predicament survival is still doubtful.

Mines

Copyright (c) 1979, 2005-2009 James L. Dean

Version 2010.10.29 released October 29, 2010

This z-machine program may be distributed or used without payment to its 
author. Derivative works must credit its author.

"Mines" lets you explore mines. The mine you explore is determined by a mine 
number specified at the beginning of a game.

The object of a game is to visit all of the rooms and return all of the 
treasures to the entrance without making too many moves.

In a mine, the passages are straight. So, for example, if you go North to leave 
a room, you can go South to reenter it. The rooms are not evenly spaced. 
However, the distance between adjacent rooms is always a multiple of the 
minimum distance between adjacent rooms.

Commands in the game are "N", "E", "S", "W", "U", and "D" to move North, East, 
South, West, Up, or Down, respectively. Other commands are "C" to carry things, 
"I" to inventory what you are carrying, "L" to leave treasures, "P" to get the 
points you've scored, "O" for help getting out of the mine, "H" for help, and 
"Q" to quit.

You wake up. A routine look at the alarm clock reveals the time; in five 
minutes, it would have gone off, but as usual, you didn't even need it. As you 
won't become more awake, you turn it off.

Bedroom (on the bed)
Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the rest of the 
house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room when you moved in. 
Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye for detail. Once or twice, 
she hinted that you have been insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but 
you do recognize the things of real practical value, like the calendar on the 
wall, at least!

Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room from 
here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite to the 
window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front of it.

On the nightstand, you can see your wallet.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
You get off the bed first.

That was a rhetorical question.

>n
From here, you can enter the living room.

>take

Taken.

Mr. Cree's port of Mr. Forman's version of "Detective", using characters from

                           MUSE: An Autumn Romance

                        [Please press SPACE to begin.]
[ And though the shadow of a sigh
    May tremble through the story,
  For 'happy summer days' gone by,
    And vanish'd summer glory --
  It shall not touch with breath of bale
  The pleasance of our fairy-tale.
  
            - Lewis Carroll,
            "Through the Looking Glass"]

The late summer of 1886 found me on the continent for the purpose of regaining 
my health and spirits. These had been in decline for the past few months, and 
it was Dr Thorne's suggestion that the best cure for me might be a change of 
scenery. A short stay in Ramsgate, perhaps. Or better yet, a visit to the Alps 
in France or Switzerland, where the fresh mountain air would do me no end of 
good. 

I had declined at first to do any such thing. I was, after all, a staid, solid 
clergyman of 59 years, mature enough to weather any foolish fluctuations of 
temper. Besides which, these frivolities cost money. 

The doctor's recommendation eventually reached the ears of my dear sister Emma, 
however, and she immediately took up the task of convincing me of the necessity 
of such a trip. But it was not until I obtained news about relatively 
inexpensive alpine destinations that I relented, and found myself packed off to 
the continent for a month. 

The month's sojourn improved my health tremendously. However, without the 
distraction of my usual work, I found the mountains did little to raise my 
spirits. And so I made my journey homeward in a state of mute distraction, even 
as the first brilliance of Autumn began to make itself known among the trees. 

All in all, it had been a smooth and uneventful trip, but for a slight pause at 
the channel. This was at a small French coastal village from which I chose to 
make my crossing, it being less expensive than the usual ferry at Calais. Here 
I stopped for a meal at the local inn, and then waited as my trunk was 
transferred from the train to pier where the boatman was waiting. 

It was only a minor pause....

Pier
The pier stretched out into the cold waters of the English Channel from the 
village east of here. Overhead, I could hear the gulls swoop and cry. The brisk 
seaside air blew in my face, carrying with it the scent of salt. Far away, 
across the waves, the white cliffs of Dover could barely be seen in the grey 
clouded light.

My trusty old steamer trunk lay here.

A fishing boat was moored beside the pier and its boatman was waiting.

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n
Other than the village to the east, there was nothing but frigid water in every 
direction.

>take
What did I want to take?

This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two 
week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center 
on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on 
that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of 
the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's 
back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition 
next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be 
just another...

Hallway
  This north-south passage is dimly lit. The hardwood floor creaks wearily with 
age. Backed against the west wall is a small coffee table. Your great uncle's 
old bedroom lies to the north, and the south archway leads to the lounge.

>no

Great Uncle's Bedroom
  You are standing in your great uncle's bedroom. There is an antique bed on 
one side of the room, and a lot of antique furniture on the other. To the south 
is the door you entered by. Light shines through a window to the north.

  An ornate bookcase stands against the wall, among the furniture.

  A very large green plant sits in a pot in the corner of the room.

On the antique bed is a brass lantern.

  As you enter the bedroom, the door slams shut!

It is time for your weekly Go lesson. You have been coming to your teacher's 
home for the past six months and though she isn't extravagant with her praise, 
you feel that your game is improving. 

Smiling inwardly, you remember your teacher's words the last time you called Go 
a 'game'. "A 'game'!" she said. "Go is not just a game - it is a reflection of 
your inner self!" 

But you sense that something is wrong: your teacher doesn't answer your knock, 
and in fact the front door is unlocked. Curious, you step inside...

Living Room
The living room is tastefully decorated. The furniture is arranged to make 
maximum use of the limited space. A bookshelf takes up one wall, while a sofa 
and end table are pushed up against another. Directly across from the sofa is a 
television.

On your last visit, a large wooden Go board occupied the space between the sofa 
and the TV, but now it's missing. The only thing left in its place are a pair 
of wooden Go bowls.

The front door is to the north, the kitchen is east and the bedroom lies to the 
south.

>no

You consider leaving, but your curiosity gets the better of you. Where is your 
teacher? Where is her valuable Go board? Should you call the police? Or is 
there a logical explanation for all of this? Thinking that maybe this is 
another of your teacher's famous "tests," you decide to press on.

Gillivray is on a rant again. His anger, like an icicle of acid, rotates around 
his place at the head of the boardroom table. It burns Atkins, to your right, 
who "apparently forgot to evolve from the apes," then swings mercifully past 
you, to smite Carter, to your left, who isn't even "up to the level of apes, 
that antediluvian amoeba!"

Gillivray's attention swings back to the middle to focus on you. So he didn't 
forget you after all: "And you, Norton, you're a man, by species at least. 
Which makes your manifold failures all the more despicable! Would you like to 
know the very definition of a shit-eating grin? Look in a mirror, Norton. 
Furthermore--"

There is no mirror. But, with an inward glance, at this moment of overwhelming 
stress, thought twists, buckles. Decades of mental training slough away. You do 
see something, behind your fixed grin. There's that caustic crystal in your 
skull: the dire compulsion of the family curse. For the last century, once the 
curse is activated, where it commands, your family must obey: GO NORTH.

You've been lucky your whole life, but no longer.

Boardroom
A high-ceilinged cell of pale polished birch. Hanging on either side of the 
room are portraits of the Walsingham brothers; Robert, with a dot-eyed face 
that glistens like polished agate, and pale, rough-skinned Alfred, whose eyes 
in contrast shine like lamps that seep hypnotic poison.

The oval table is crowded with all the senior employees; foam-flecked Gillivray 
at the head, and moving clockwise, Mockerby, Shardlow, Ferne, Williams, Ford, 
Atkins, you (Norton), Carter, Patson, Ripon, Goodenough, and Clevars.

A large doorway heads south into main lobby. A small door leads east to a 
washroom. A smaller back door, to the north, leads outside.

If you do not choose to go north then you shall die.

"HERE BE DRAGONS" is what the rutter said, but the small island turned out to

full of friendly natives.

Aaah, shore leave! You can't remember when the last time was you could relax,

Village Center
The center of this small village is a roughly circular clearing in the 
jungle-forest that covers most of this island. A gigantic tree stands in the 
middle, reaching hundreds of feet up into the cool night air. The huts of the 
villagers are strewn around the clearing's border, close to the jungle.
A large stone circle contains charred wood from last night's bonfire, and there 
is a rickety wooden platform under one of the lower branches of the tree.

As you start to walk, you sense movement from the corner of your eye. You turn

hand, gently pulling you towards what seems to be her hut.

The OKAY button is blinking again.

Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear to be 
suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the only one in the 
room, because there's no room in here for anyone else.  The OKAY button is also 
buzzing, with the patented Elevated Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain 
irritating no matter how often one is forced to hear it.  Somehow the most 
annoying part, though, is that the blinking and the buzzing are slightly out of 
sync.

Your "station" is a solid metal enclosure just barely large enough to 
accommodate your chair and yourself.  On the wall in front of you are the many 
brightly-colored controls of the security console and a black-and-white

On the monitor you can see Engineer Ghee performing calisthenics in the engine 
room.  Presumably the machinery is operating normally.

>While you've come to think of the direction your feet face as "down", it's 
really just the direction of the ship's engines.  For this part of the journey, 
that's the direction of your destination.  You'll be constantly decelerating at 
1G until you reach Covetous.  At any rate, all directions have long since 
become irrelevant until you once again enjoy freedom of movement in a world

Lying in the darkness, feeling something wet and slimy on my back, I see a 
shaft of moonlight piercing down from somewhere above. I see her face, her 
innocent face, looking at me, and I hear her utter those two words...

And then it all fades away, the fog comes rolling over my memory like a morning 
on Tantus 7. I try to get up, but my surroundings sway as my head pounds. 
Finally, it all settles down just enough, and I try to take stock of my 
situation.

This game is (C)2007 David Hughes.

It's probably for the best (or worst?) that you gave money to a begging gypsy 
that one time, because now, you can travel between this realm a somewhat 
identical, parallel realm by saying "up" or "down." You're just that gifted, 
kid.  You've seen some strange things in the other world--your friends replaced 
with monsters, your things replaced with, uh, other things, and other strange 
ideas. You tried to tell this to your family, but they didn't believe you. Big 
mistake, my friend.

Now you're in a psych ward. You'd do anything to get out of this hellhole. Even 
the family that put you in wants you back - but the doctors keep diagnosing 
problems you know you don't have. The good news is that Maggie, the supervising 
nurse, won't notice you unless you go past her desk. The bad news is, well, 
you're not out yet.

But tonight is when you decided to make your getaway. Tomorrow's your big 
medical evaluation, and none other than Maggie, who's called you an 
"aggravating spider" just yesterday, is representing you. Why would you not 
escape?

Bedroom
Maggie has called lights-out for the evening. The window lets in a small amount 
of pink light from a gas station sign outside. You're in your green-walled 
bedroom in one of the wings of the psych ward, with an exit to the North.

The teddy bear you brought from home is sitting in a dull, dusty trance on the 
nightstand.

Main Hallway
The walls are a different shade of green, but still green. There are visible 
exits to the West - to the West hallway, and East - to Maggie's desk. Sitting 
in a corner of the main hallway is an action figure.

There appears to have been a green door leading to the front desk, but only the 
frame remains.

There is also some kid's sculpture made in arts and crafts here.

You can also see an action figure here.

Welcome to Paranoia!

HOW TO PLAY

Very occasionally during this adventure, you will be given a choice of things 
to do. Always choose the least dangerous option. Continue doing this until you 
win. At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and will be informed of 
the outcome. These sections will be self explanatory. There are a few other 
commands you can use -- type 'help' to find out about them.

HOW TO DIE

As Philo-R-DMD, you will die several times during the adventure. A new clone 
will be activated to take the place of the one that died, in a different 
location. The new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old 
Philo-R's path; hopefully he won't make the same mistakes as his predecessor.

HOW TO WIN

Simply complete the mission before expending all six of your clones. 
Remember... stay alert, and keep your laser handy.

You have worked at the Institute of Transportation for nearly five years. As 
one of the engineering team in the Research and Development section, it is 
considered a highly respected position and is particularly well paid. In recent 
years it has become even more important, as with a growing population the 
global transport system is struggling to cope. A complete collapse has been 
predicted in a little under five years time.

You are currently working on the Pathway project which is a new developmental 
Rapid Transit System (RTS).  This holds out the promise of fast, efficient and 
cheap travel.  You do not fully understand the science behind it but it has 
something to do with particles, magnetism and time travel. Basically, you 
arrive at your destination the exact same moment you leave your starting point.

The initial trials have been extremely promising and the first long distance 
test is now underway. The intent was for you to be "particled" (as it is 
called) from one side of the planet to the other and then back again. They 
strapped you into a chair situated in the centre of the testing chamber and the 
senior technician on the project gave you the thumbs up sign from the control 
room.  First your hands and feet started to tingle, then your vision blurred, 
then... nothing.

A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking 
through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  
You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last 
grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off 
for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching 
and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle 
your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty 
much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you 
were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly 
forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you 
had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous 
assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of 
private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further 
abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the 
Pentari millitary supply center.

Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open 
area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the

the distant shouts of another Company drilling.  Poor souls.

Town Square
Tasteful pastels and neons form a concrete square around an anomalous growth in 
the form of a large tree. The odd walls and spires surrounding give the

A Market, of Sorts
One man's market is another man's somewhat dilapidated looking corner with the

such is a cart that probably held items once but looks pretty barren at the 
moment. The pastel motif does do a bit to lighten things up, though. Roads wind 
their way west and southeast.

Jammed into the frame of the cart is an official "L'il Terrorist Flamethrower."

You can also see a haystack and a bag of llama feed here.

Speeding down Montgomery Boulevard
The streetlights are bright. Unbearably bright. You have to squint as hard as 
you can to keep your retinas from bursting into flame.

"Welcome back to the land of the LIVING, bud," Rob says. "You planning to stick 
around for a while or you gonna pass out again? Cause one thing I've learned 
about chicks is that they actually DON'T LIKE IT when you pass out on them in 
the middle of gettin' it on. You hear me? So if that's, like, your PLAN, then 
I'm droppin' you off and showin' up solo."

You don't exactly remember where the day went, but as you listen to Rob rant 
on, bits of it start to float back to you: a day on the slopes, the brisk 
February wind against your face; polishing off a keg back at the lodge; those 
two girls you and Rob had hit it off with, the ones who'd given you their 
address in town. "We all should get together sometime!" they'd said. Of course, 
Rob insisted that by "sometime" they'd meant "later tonight." You hadn't been 
so sure, but then you'd blacked out before you could argue the point.

How Rob came to be driving your car you're not exactly sure. Apparently he 
couldn't wait till you were sober enough to drive it yourself. From the way 
he's weaving all over the road, he also apparently couldn't wait till HE was 
sober enough to drive it, either.

Rob looks over his shoulder as if about to change lanes but then turns on the 
windshield wipers instead of the turn signal. "Oops," he says.

A strange phosphorescent smoke covered the area, catching several hues from an 
unknown light source. A charge was in the air, as if lightning were about to 
strike. The hairs on the back of my neck were erect. I had this terrible 
feeling that at any moment someone would wander up and ask me to dance.

Piracy 2.0 - A Text Adventure in Space

by Sean Huxter 

Your shift began like most others as Captain of the United Worlds Guardian 
Class Patrol vessel, U.W.S. Ceres, a routine supply mission of no particular 
import, routine crew checks, signing this order, monitoring that communication, 
so it was not only a surprise, but an unexpected honor when your mentor, 
Admiral Copeland, contacted you by secure sub-etha channel to charge you with a 
highly sensitive mission. 

James Whitehall, perhaps this era's most renowned and reviled interstellar 
pirate, was cornered with his crew and captured yesterday out on the galactic 
rim, and he wasn't taken quietly. Though when the moment approached, 
Whitehall's crew bailed and fled in their tattered ship, abandoning their 
leader to the law. Under heavy guard, Whitehall was transported to the U.W.S. 
Orion, another Guardian Class ship, which was heavily damaged in the arrest 
operation. The Orion had to undergo immediate drydock repairs, but it was the 
only spaceworthy ship in the vicinity. 

Your mission was to rendezvous with the Orion and take charge of this deadly 
prisoner, allowing the Orion to get back to spacedock without further delay. 

The route you were instructed to take was a coded, randomly-generated series of 
course corrections which would have sent anyone trying to intercept you on a 
wild goose chase, as you were eventually to arrive and dock at Penal Satellite 
One, where Whitehall would be held until trial. 

You know the Admiral was putting some portion of his reputation on the line 
trusting you with this job, and you weren't about to let him down. 

But it didn't turn out that way. There must have been a leak somewhere, either 
on your ship or at United Worlds Command, because in an isolated sector of open 
space you were approached and attacked by a ramshackle pirate cruiser. 

The pirate crew had come for their leader. They made their intentions clear 
immediately, ordering you to heave to and be boarded. 

Of course you were not about to give up your prisoner without a fight, but 
their rag-tag ship, festooned with weapons, outgunned your ship's meager trio 
of laser cannons and its small crew. 

After an all-too-brief battle your ship was boarded, and as far as you know, 
your crew completely wiped out by the ruthless marauders. You wonder why you're 
still alive, guessing that your good fortune comes only due to the possibility 
you may yet be of some use to the pirates. 

Now, Whitehall, with a keycode for the Brig he must have tortured out of your 
Security Officer, escorts you personally to the cell and shoves you in. He 
laughs as the door locks behind you... 

(For information about Piracy 2.0, type HELP at any prompt. For a Walkthrough, 
type WALKTHROUGH.)

Brig
You're in a small, smooth-walled room with barely enough area to stand. A pair 
of simple bunk beds occupy most of the cramped space. There is a panel near the 
door. A faint smell of ozone is coming from the vent high above the beds. The 
pirates must have started some electrical fires. The only door is north, but 
it's closed and locked.

It's been a long day, yes sir, but you'll be in Santa Fe by evening. It's still 
mid-afternoon, and you're grateful that the window is open to give you a little 
air. Outside, the New Mexico desert stretches from horizon to horizon. The 
other passengers are dozing in the gently-rocking car, and conversation has 
long since flagged. Nothing to smell but the scent of stale pipe tobacco 
mingled with the sooty smoke from the engine and the desert dust. Nothing to 
hear but the endless clack-clack-clack of the wheels. You pull down your 
hat-brim and settle down for a snooze.

This first-class carriage is furnished as comfortably as these things come, 
although the red upholstery has been faded by the pitiless sun, and you can see 
the marks of repaired bullet holes here and there - no doubt the scars of an 
Indian attack, although the Santa Fe line has been quiet for the last few 
months. The gas lamps attached to the ceiling swing slowly back and forth in 
time with the monotonous clack-clack-clack of the train wheels on the rails.

Suddenly, you hear a shout, and the sound of running feet. Surprised, you lift 
your hat, to find people crowded around the window opposite, pointing and 
yelling excitedly. They must have spotted something mighty interesting. Might

Void: The Center
This is the center, apparently. The planes of existence stretch out around you; 
some open and beckoning, some blocked to your spirit. Most are esoteric and of 
little importance to you, but you are drawn to several: the physical, or literal
 plane; the plane of structure; the plane of shape; and the plane of essence.

This place seems to revolve around a multi-dimensional object, a monolith which 
seems to continue through all the planes. Your sight cannot penetrate it.

     The e-mail has a surprising tone for a declaration of doom.

--------------------
From: Your Boss!
To: You
CC: Everyone

     Congratualtions!  Due to attrition among the ranks of middle managers, you 
have been promoted to management as of right now.  Have someone move your 
telephone and computer to your new office in the management section, and call 
me before the end of the day.

--------------------

     There is no reason to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for you.  
First, that message went to everyone, announcing that you have been promoted.  
As soon as your back is turned it will be so full of daggers you could open a 
cutlery shop.  On top of that, your phone has been broken for months.

     You tried begging, bribery, even threats.  You just can not get a new 
phone.  Now, you have to move to the new office, with a new phone, before the 
end of the day.  If you don't, you won't lose the promotion, you will lose your 
job.  Most new managers become sacrificial scapegoats for the board of 
directors on their first day.

     You will just have to be smarter than those other fledgling managers.  If 
you have problems, you can always resort to "Big D's Guide to Corporate 
Survival" (ie. the walkthrough).  You keep it in your desk drawer.

    Well, there is work to be done.  Get that phone and get your equipment to 
the new office.

At the Show
You're in a dark, poorly lit and packed club. Everyone's staring at the band as 
they go about tuning and shifting their instruments. The guy next to you has a 
mohawk that flops over to the side, as if the heat had wilted it. In contrast, 
the skinhead in front of you is reacting to the heat like a Mexican jumping 
bean, the muscles of his back tensing and releasing, tensing and releasing.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
Before you can do anything, the band explodes into action. The crowd coalesces 
into a single entity and leans towards them, falls back, ripples spastically. 
Being part of this lurching creature makes your spine tingle.

You're pressed from all sides by people suddenly activated by sound -- but you 
can't hear anything. You can practically feel the sonic waves, see it on the 
faces of the people around you... You strain to hear the music... 

The guy with the mohawk plants his boot in the skinhead's linked hands. His 
pierced nostrils flaring, hands gripping the skinhead's shoulders, he launches 
himself on the crowd. Improbably, they hold him aloft as he rolls over a bed 
made of their shoulders, heads and outstretched hands. You can't quite believe 
what you're seeing, and suddenly you hear something:

"Honey?"

You whip around and look to see who spoke, but there's nothing except the 
unremarkable brick wall of the club lined with people standing on chairs to get 
a better view. None of them are looking at you.

You look back. The guy with the mohawk is still rolling over the crowd, but for 
some reason he's got a tie on. And his blue hair is flickering like flames. The 
skinhead offers his linked hands to boost you up, and you quickly put your foot 
in. But your foot is bare. He looks at you, his dark eyes questioning. You 
realize with dawning horror that it isn't just your foot that's bare -- you're  
in your underwear. You feel, rather than see, the eyes of the people in the 
crowd move towards you, brace yourself for the mocking laughter sure to 
ensue... 

"Honey! Get up!"

You're in your bed.

Your mother bustles in with your uniform, freshly ironed, and hangs it on your 
bathroom doorknob. "OK, honey, we're off," she says, stopping at the foot of 
your bed and putting her hands on her hips. "Better hurry or you'll miss your 
bus. Don't want to be late for the very first day of high school!"

You smile weakly as she kisses you goodbye and leaves, trying to rekindle the 
feelings in your dream.

Your Room (on the bed)
Your room is a mess -- posters slowly peel off the walls to join the small 
heaps of clothes that spot the floor like death mounds. There's a path south 
through the junk from your bed to your bathroom, one going north to the rest of 
the house.

You can see a school uniform here.

A small room.  Three men; you recognize only one.

"You, Soteria," says the leader.  "I understand you have an invitation to the 
Celebration of the Night of the Comet."

Heat floods your face.  How does he know that?  "I have an invitation, but I 
wasn't sure-- that is, I wasn't planning--"

"You'll go," he says.

The words die half-formed.  An urgent command overrides your personal doubts.

"What am I to do?"

"Speak to the Physician -- he's one of ours, but we've been unable to speak to 
him of late.  Find out anything he knows about the King's illness.  And protect 
the King."

"From what?"

The leader smiles a little wryly.  "I wish I could tell you, girl.  This is the 
Night of the Comet.  It could be anything."

                    [ Hit RETURN to continue... ]

As you turn to go, one of the others touches your arm.  "How did you get an 
invitation? We've all been trying for months--"

"Someone gave it to me," you say curtly.  "A rendezvous of sorts."

"But--"

"Don't worry, I'll attend to my duty," you say.  Adding, mostly to yourself: 
"The masked man won't be there anyway, I'm sure."  Since he became an outlaw 
shortly after he invited you...

Terrace
A terrace of lunar marble, surrounded by a low balustrade.  It gleams softly of 
its own in the darkening night.

To the west, shallow steps descend to the enclosure of the Square Garden; east 
beckons the brilliance of the Sun Court.

The minister of the moon stands at the far end, gazing upwards.

Many years ago, when the Iron Branch was passed down from king to king (instead 
of being a pile of rust in an overadorned urn), when dragons walked the earth 
(instead of flying about like the maniacs they are now), when Strongle was the 
God of Gods (instead of being, well, I think the polite term is "deposed")... 
back when all of that was taking place, magic had yet to be conquered by mere 
mortal man.

What's that got to do with you, you ask? Well, since you're an apprentice to 
one of those men who are trying to figure out how magic works, you get to do 
all the dirty deeds.

A few weeks ago, Apaman (the loser you're apprenticed to) had sent you to 
recover the Hestron (one of the jewels in the Sceptre of Charlten). Despite 
your success on that mission, Apaman is not treating you any better. Your best 
guess is that many of the Hestron's secrets remain hidden to him, and he's 
taking his frustrations out on the nearest convenient target.

Now he's learnt about something that may help him unlock those secrets, and has 
sent you on another mission: to retrieve the sky rock from the north tower of 
Fossen Festning, a fortress built into the side of a mountain beside a large 
waterfall. All you've brought with you is a dark cloak and an old grappling 
hook that Apaman was generous enough to loan to you. All you need to bring out 
is the sky rock.

Good luck with that.

Beneath the North Tower
A dark tower rises high above you, lit dimly in the cloud-obscured moonlight. 
The sound of a waterfall is nearby but somewhat muted by the high walls of the 
fortress. To your south is the main courtyard, and directly west of you is the 
face of the cliff into which the fortress was built.

>I beg your pardon?

>You start to make your way around and see the entrance to the tower, but you

I am standing on the platform of a railway station - it's miserable, it's damp, 
and all the seats are taken by stuck-up grannies and biddies and ghastly 
yacht-clubbers. While waiting for the train, which is taking ages, I peer over 
to the opposite platform, and notice a familiar figure. I can't believe it! 
It's Daniel! After all these years! But he hasn't noticed me yet. Barely able 
to conceal the joy in my voice, I step over to the edge of the platform and 
shout "Daniel Maguire! What the FUCK are you doing here?" And he notices me and 
shouts "Alex Moran, would you ever shut the FUCK up, you cross-eyed WANKER!" 
And I reply "Go FUCK yourself, ASSHOLE!" and he replies "Suck me off, you BENT 
BASTARD!". And the two of us run up and down the platforms, joyously shouting 
abuse at each other across three lines of track. And all the stuck-up grannies 
and biddies and ghastly yacht-clubbers waiting at the station stare at us as if 
we are mad. But we carry on, running up and down, screaming profanities, and 
let the rest of the world GO FUCK ITSELF!

Dormitory Room (on my bunkbed)
I wake up.

With horror I realise that I'll have to spend another day in St. Enda's 
college. A familiar fact I have to face each morning - but four years here have 
not made it any easier to face. St. Enda's - how I have come to despise this 
place. A decrepit old red-brick shag-pile which has become the focal point of 
this filthy little town in the arse-end of nowhere. The cheapest boarding 
school in the country, probably, but also surely the most pompous and inflated. 
A haven for the worst kind of social climbers, parvenus, thick, ignorant 
farmers' sons....

With horror I also realise that I am an asshole. Another familiar fact, and the 
last seventeen years have given me little reason to doubt it. I could happily 
pick apart my faults all day - I'm too short, too shy, indecisive, and 
uncharismatic. And I've got terrible posture.

The dormitory is a small, frequently claustrophobic room that somehow fits four 
bunkbeds, which are stacked up on opposite walls. There is a sink in one corner 
and an old wardrobe in another. The doorway leads east. A solitary window 
allows a cold light into the room.

Wayne and Paddy are lying asleep in their bunkbeds.

Coffee House
The book on the round, maroon table is looking at you. In this sunny May 
afternoon, you wanted to read the book and be outside also. So you took it and 
came to this coffee house. You are wondering what the protagonist will do next.

You glance at the people who are in light colored clothes and look somewhat 
dizzy from the lightly blowing wind. The umbrella over you provides an ideal 
dimness. From the speaker near the entrance of the inner caf, a woman is 
singing an ultimately boring French song.

Thus, everything is so suitable to read.

          The Resident

  'You just visit the WEB, I live here.'

  Copyright 1995 by Mike DeSanto

  You are awake.  The clock says it is 2: 30 AM, so thee must be a reason you 
are awake.  Trusting your instincts, you get the Beretta handlaser from the end 
table.

  You move silently toward the bedroom door.  There are people who hate you, 
but most of them don't know who you are, and you just moved in here.  A change 
of residence and name come with every completed job.  There have been no 
hitches or displeased customers lately.

  Just as you reach for the door these thoughts are shattered.  The door 
disappears in a blinding, searing light.  Through the agony you feel the 
dresser opposite the door hit you in the small of the back, a trivial pain to 
the fire in the front of your body.

  Then something else starts.  A pushing feeling starting at your right hip.  
It continues diagonally to your left shoulder, leaving sharp points of 
suffering, like ten thousand bee stings across your body.  You feel yourself 
falling, but never feel the floor.

  With a start, you are awake.  Looking around, you see the red traceries and 
yellow disks of the WEB stretching out all around you.  you must have fallen 
asleep on line again.

  Your left arm itches, you must be laying on it.  You reach for the LOGOUT 
button, and find nothing.  The logout is gone.  Looking around a little more, 
everything is gone!  Your programs, even your Icon!  You spent hours on that 
icon.  Getting just the right amount of five o'clock shadow, just the right 
tackiness to the slippers.  It was a masterpiece!

  Just as you are starting to get nervous, a message appears on your deck.  
Strange dreams just before strange messages make you unhappy.  At least you 
have your backups at Bob's.

    You are standing in a standard Public node.  The 'ground' is a neon yellow 
disk, large enough for everyone present to fit, no matter how many people are 
here.

    In the center of the disk is a red pole with arrow shaped signs.  This is 
the transfer point to all connected nodes.

    Next to the Transfer Point is a large sign which reads "INFORMATION" in 
tall block capitals.  You can not read the rest without looking more closely.

    As usual, there are hundreds of people moving through this node.  Since 
this is where everyone starts when they log in, it tends to be a busy place.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are 
currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during 
the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing 
instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think 
what it might be.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
Nobody asked you anything, doofus.

>n
The front of the pizza parlor is southwest.

>take
(yourself)
Taken.

You are now holding yourself. In the self you see yourself, which contains 
yourself. Yourself contains...

On second thought, let's NOT do that.

You've heard about them from others. You've even had them yourself: classes 
that seem to last forever. But this one takes the biscuit. You wonder what 
possessed you to sign up for Celtic Elements in Early Teutonic Settlements: a 
field of study so narrow and boring, you'd wonder they would award doctorates 
in it. But they must, for the chap running the lecture has one.

You glance down at the notebook in your hands, but the thought of recording all 
this boredom for posterity doesn't thrill you. Instead, you look around the 
hall, wondering if you could sneak out and find something better to do with 
your time.

Lecture Hall (on the seat)
An ordinary, run-of-the-mill lecture hall. Its many banks of tiered seats run 
up towards the large and heavy double doors at the west end. Down at floor 
level, at the east end of the hall, the professor is teaching the lesson. Tiers 
upon tiers of bored students sit in the seats.

An empty cup of yogurt, the remains of your elevenses, sits on the desk.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

"Now if you remember, in the course syllabus, I mentioned we would begin by 
discussing the settling instincts of early German nomad tribes," lectures the 
professor.

>(getting out of your desk first)
"Students shall please remain seated while the lecture is in progress," intones 
the professor as you stand up.

As desperate as you are to escape, you can't claw your way through the walls.

"It's fascinating to note that as the early Teutons shifted from nomads to 
village-dwellers, they started by building huts," declaims the professor.

"You can't miss it," they said. "A white house in a clearing with a small 
mailbox outside; just open the kitchen window and the entrance to the Great 
Underground Empire isn't far away."

You found the house and the window all right, and a trapdoor leading down. But 
as the trapdoor crashed shut behind you, you realized that something was very 
wrong. Surely the GUE shouldn't look like a large square room with bare walls, 
and what about those menacing shapes advancing towards you...?

First they washed you.  They rubbed your skin with a soft cloth, made you clean

Then they put you out with the others, to wait for passers-by.

Welcome to the worlds of Infocom's interactive fiction. This Sampler contains a 
Tutorial and samples of four Infocom titles: Zork I, Planetfall, Infidel, and 
The Witness.

The Tutorial is an introduction to the concept of interactive fiction. In it, 
you will be taken through a brief sample scenario that will allow you to become 
comfortable with the way to converse with these stories. After the tutorial, 
there will be a brief explanation of how Infocom's interactive fiction is 
different from others you might see or hear about.

The sample of Zork I, a fantasy game, includes everything through your 
discovery of the main caverns of the Great Underground Empire. In Planetfall, a 
science fiction game, you will scramble to survive a shipwreck and land on a 
deserted world. If you play Infidel, one of our Tales of Adventure, the sample 
will include your search for an ancient pyramid buried beneath the desert 
sands. The sample of The Witness will give you a glimpse of the action in this 
30's-style detective thriller.

Welcome to Infocom's interactive fiction tutorial. Infocom's line represents 
the state of the art in interactive computer story-telling. In these stories, 
YOU are the main character. The final outcome is determined solely by YOUR 
actions. We offer a full line of interactive stories in such genres as Mystery, 
Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Tales of Adventure. This is a tutorial 
introduction to Infocom's interactive fiction.

In what follows, text in parentheses (here is an example) is part of the 
tutorial and not part of the game itself. Infocom's stories start with a 
description of your location within the story. At the end of the description 
comes the prompting character ">", which indicates that the game is waiting for 
you to decide what to do next. If you can't think of what to do, type HELP. Hit

Welcome to the world of Infocom's interactive fiction! This Sampler contains an 
interactive fiction Tutorial, as well as excerpts from three Infocom titles: 
Zork I, Trinity, and Leather Goddesses of Phobos.

The Tutorial will introduce you to the concept of interactive fiction. In it,

popular Infocom title. You'll learn how to communicate with an Infocom story, 
and pick up tips for solving the types of puzzles you'll encounter in the other 
excerpts. We recommend that you try the Tutorial first, especially if you've 
had little or no experience with interactive fiction.

The excerpt from Zork I, Infocom's classic fantasy story, includes your 
discovery of the ancient caverns of the Great Underground Empire. In the 
Leather Goddesses of Phobos sample, you'll frolick through a zany parody of 
1930's pulp space opera. In Trinity, a contemporary fantasy, you will search 
for a dimensional door leading to a strange universe in which fantasy meets 
reality.

You are in the common room of a small quad in Holder, a lovely gothic

There are doors to the south, the west, and the southwest.

On the messy desk is a computer disk.

Bedroom (on the bed)
When the springy energy of muscle long ago gave way to a slothful paunch, you 
didn't mind. You simply redirected your energies from the libertine idylls of 
youth to the ruthless game of business, and in that you succeeded admirably. 
You built Splinecorp from the humble beginnings of your parents' garage into 
the world's most prominent manufacturer of electronic goods. You invested your 
whole adult life into the company, and it paid you back handsomely, you 
sometimes consider as you relax in your sprawling, isolated mansion. But age 
takes its toll. Even your healthy middle-aged paunch began to dissolve, what 
remained of your muscles were consumed by sluggish board meetings, and 
innumerable diseases began to gnaw at you from the inside out. Your increasing 
frailty has confined you to this bed for the last five years, but your mind, of 
course, is as sharp as ever and you have no intent of relinquishing your place 
on the Splinecorp executive board. Fortunately, here in your linen prison, 
you've provided yourself with the tools to look after yourself: the rack of 
monitors hanging from ceiling keeps you informed, and of course your faithful 
Splinecorp-manufactured robots stand by, waiting your command. Hanging on the 
eastern wall is an ornate tapestry. And standing next to your bed is a 
comprehensive array of tubes, drips, and associated medical machines, and also 
a small nightstand. To the south is a doorway to the hallway.

The phone starts ringing.

You can see Levo and Pravo here.

                              School Days: Prologue

You have recently lived in Toronto but then your parents moved away. You really 
loved them. But, you were kidnapped and locked in this house. Those kidnappers 
really should be put in jail.

Well, you don't want to stay here any longer than you can help. You want to get 
to school on this Saturday to see your grade nine pals. And last night you were 
shoved in this house. As you wake up, you realise...

                          [Please press any key to begin.]

... that you are all alone in a locked bedroom, and you need to find a way out.

Schooldays Version 3 is Copyright (c) 2000 Andrew MacKinnon.
New users might want to type 'help'.

Bedroom
This bedroom is a medium-sized room, with an ugly flower wallpaper. A dresser 
sits in an awkward corner. An entrance to a small bathroom is to the west while 
the door to the main corridor to the east. A cheap window sits at one side. A 
trapdoor in the ceiling seems to lead up to an attic, although high up.

The door to the hallway is currently closed.

The trapdoor is closed, blocking the way into the attic.

A mahogany double dresser sits here. In the dresser, there are no open drawers.

You can also see a wall clock, a night-table (on which are an air freshener and 
a lamp) and a bed (on which are some sheets) here.

Vega was unusually bright tonight, and you followed it all the way to the 
trainyard.  Hopped the fence, and now you're standing in front of an open 
boxcar headed... somewhere.   The city hasn't been the same since they left.  
Not a hurried exodus.  More like a gradual diaspora, in a traditional sense.  
Graduate programs, marriages, new jobs, and all of a sudden, you're on your 
own.

Train Yard
The train yard is lit exclusively by shrill halogen lights.  The freight train 
in front of you is carrying grain and departing at 2100.  The afore-mentioned 
boxcar is a dusty blue, with some scrawled graffiti along the bottom.  From the 
limited view afforded by the open door, the boxcar appears to be empty.  Your 
sense of direction is a little shaky right now, but if you had to guess, the 
boxcar would be north of you.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

Boxcar Interior
The inside of the boxcar is dusty and empty. Spacious.  Perfect for a jaunt.

The boxcar shudders into motion, and you watch your city shrink in size through 
the open doors.

Riding the Rails
The boxcar hums with motion, swaying gently from side to side.  The moon and 
the stars shine with an almost unnatural brilliance, filling your conveyance 
with soft blue light.  You haven't seen this many stars in a very long time.

The Director's office surprises you. You had expected something modern with 
clean lines, and plenty of glass and aluminium; not this dark and cluttered 
room, reminiscent of a Victorian library or some ancient professor's study. 
Also, you had expected that you were being shown in for an interview with the 
Director, in person, whereas there is clearly no-one else here in this office.

about the puzzles).

Press any key to begin the game.

The Director's assistant follows you into the room. 

"As I told you, the Board of Trustees were impressed with your interview and 
they fully understand from your application why you see this as your perfect 
job. However, you failed to convince them on a single point: if you wish to 
become the new Director of the Museum and Institute for Puzzles and Problem 
Solving, they would like some evidence of your interest in solving problems. 
The retiring Director has been asked to assess you on that single point and, 
rather than interview you, he has set you an unusual test." 

With that, the assistant hands you a manilla envelope, then continues. 

"I am instructed to give you this envelope. Please read it and act on its 
contents. When you are ready to meet the Director, please ring the bell on his 
desk and I shall bring him in. He will ask you a single question. If you answer 
correctly, the job is yours: answer incorrectly and we shall have to look for a 
new candidate." 

The assistant moves briskly out of the room, wishing you a cheery "Good luck!" 
before shutting the door behind him. You hear the sound of a key being turned 
in the lock.

Office of the Director
This room reminds you of a Victorian study: it is roughly square and all the 
exposed walls are panelled with dark oak, up to a height of about six feet, 
with bare cream plaster above. In the centre of the room is an old mahogany 
desk, with a leather chair behind it. Beyond the desk is a stone fireplace, 
with a framed painting above it. One of the side walls is completely taken up 
with a book case, most of which is closed with glass doors. On the opposite 
wall, above a wooden table, is the only window, and sole source of light in 
this rather gloomy room. In the fourth wall is the single door. There is a 
clutter of miscellaneous items everywhere, and in the four corners of the room, 
you can see a hatstand, an antique globe, a wooden corner shelf and a low 
cupboard. 

At present you are standing beside the Director's desk, in the middle of the 
room.

On the mahogany desk are a blotter, a bell, a newspaper, a brown book and a 
magazine.

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n
The compass directions aren't relevant: firstly, there is only one exit (which 
is locked!) and, secondly, you don't have a compass. Although you can 
distinguish up and down, without a compass, there are no exits in those 
directions, either.

>take
(off the top hat)
You leave the desk and walk over towards the hatstand.

You're not wearing that.

No! My shiniest of shiny objects! Don't fly aw--- Come back! I love you!

Well, now that my girlfriend's mad at me, where were we? Ah, right.

It's kind of boring here. I hear the king hasn't put anybody in the dungeon in 
over a year. Must make you feel special. It's drafty, being up in the tower, 
and the stones in the wall have chips and various--- do you really care? 
They're old. The door looks pretty sturdy. There's some light coming into the

I can see a tapestry, a bed, a vase, a mirror, and an annoying git in a dress

The last thing that you remember is standing before the wizard Lakmir as he 
waved his hands. Now you find yourself staring at an entryway which lies at the 
edge of a forest. The druid's words ring in your ears:

"Within the castle Shadowgate lies your quest. The dreaded Warlock Lord will 
use his black magic to raise the Behemoth from the dark depths. The combination 
of his evil arts and the great titan's power will surely destroy us all! You 
are the last of the line of kings, the seed of prophecy that was foretold eons 
ago. Only you can stop the evil one from darkening our world forever! Fare thee 
well."

Gritting your teeth, you swear by your god's name that you will destroy the 
Warlock Lord!

Entrance
You are standing just south of the Castle Shadowgate. In front of you, to the 
north, is a heavy wooden door set in the stone wall of the castle. A skull 
hangs over the door.

Hall
You stand in a long corridor. Huge stone archways line the entire hall. At the north end of this room is an impressive hall door covered with sheets of steel. A small door is to the east. 

A huge pair of disembodied eyes appear high in the air above you, glaring angrily. The booming voice of the Warlock Lord bursts forth from nowhere.

"That pitiful wizard Lakmir was a fool to send a buffoon like you to stop me. You will surely regret it for the only thing here for you is a horrible death!"

The eyes fade away as if made of smoke. Maniacal laughter echoes in your ears.

A beautifully woven rug is in the middle of the room.

You can also see two unlit torches here.

Release 3 / Serial number 001127 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Odd, how the light just makes your apartment gloomier. Pre-dawn darkness pools 
in the corners and around the tops of walls. Your desk lamp glares yellow, but 
the shadows only draw your eyes and deepen.

Not much of an apartment, no. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty computer 
shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on a cardboard 
crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the other, with a closet to 
the side. A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it 
halfway works. One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

Your luggage is piled untidily by the door. A potted hyacinth sits beneath the 
window.

You are sprawled on the futon, staring up into that gloom. Your eyes feel 
gritty. But it's too late -- early -- no time left for sleep, anyway. In a few 
hours your ride will arrive.

On the desk are your to-do list and a travel book.

  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -

  And that has made all the difference.
  
  -- Robert Frost, "The Road Not Taken"]

Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of the 
breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia. As if she 
weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their breast-plates red in the 
setting sun, march ahead of the procession and protect you from seeing anything 
unrehearsed. It's a dog's life being an Ambassador.

Watling Street (in the cushioned basket)
The ancient paved road stretches for miles to the south, turning very slowly to 
the northeast along a mossy stone wall. From up here on your elephant's

hunting woods inside the wall.

Having been stuck in this cushioned basket with the Lady Amilia every day for a

Behind the bar sits a bartender.
A sign hanging over him says:  'Beer $100  Whiskey $100'.
The place isn't furnished too well. A curtain hangs on one wall.
Next to the curtain is a button.
A fan whirls slowly overhead - moving the stagnant air around.

Other areas are:  north and west.

Items in sight are:  a button, the bartender, a beer, a curtain and a shot of 
whiskey.

I'm on a Street outside the Bar

I'm on the sidewalk outside the bar.
A couple stray dogs wander around. A cat is crouched in the entrance watching 
the dogs.
Old beat-up cars drive by. The sirens of police cars and ambulances wail in the 
distance.
Some paper blows by - from the overfilled garbage dumpster next to me. I just 
miss stepping on a dogs "calling card". The dogs look at me - I hope they don't 
think I'm a fire hydrant!

Other areas are:  south.

Items in sight are:  a sign.

         [->]

Classes finally ended, and you walk home through the nearly deserted campus. 
It's a Thursday, and you had night classes, so almost no one is around. Up a 
few flights of stairs, you slip the key into the lock, turn, and walk inside. 
Turning swiftly, you lock the door, and pick up your todo list. Still, you just 
don't feel like doing work. Your heart is heavy, and you feel you won't really 
be able to get anything done.

Dorm Room
This is your room, where you've have some of your most cherished moments. It's 
been just about half a year since the start of classes, but even in that short 
period, you've made many memories. Mornings are the most pleasant here, 
sunlight shines through the windows, casting the room in the golden hue of the 
dawn. Your desk is decorated with pictures, pencils, snacks, and books. The 
walls are sparse, mostly white, no posters or anything, you prefer it neat. 
Almost everything is ordered, and not a thing is usually out of place. Your bed 
is in one corner of the room. The windows are dark, it's night time out.

A nightstand is beside the desk, with a few frills on top.

A fair sized metal typewriter is on the desk.

Your writing notebook rests here, but it's unimportant to you.

It's been ten years since your stationfall on Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 
777-G 59/59. Your heroics in saving the galaxy from the evil alien pyramid 
resulted in a big promotion, but your life of dull paperwork has been replaced 
by a life of dull people work: escorting ambassadors, high-ranking officers of 
the Stellar Patrol, and government officials; and inspecting starships and 
space stations. Today you find yourself in a space scooter bound for a space 
station to perform a spot check, and also deliver some radioactive isotopes for 
their reactor, using the scooter instead of the teleport in order to surprise 
everyone. You've been a bit delayed due to a diplomatic crisis on Omicron III 
and your scooter isn't equipped with communication equipment, so you are 
arriving unannounced. Hey, rank does have its privileges, and it is meant to be 
a spot check...

Scooter (on the pilot's couch)
   You are in the cramped one-man Class Eight Space Scooter, with a couch for 
the pilot. Through the viewport, you see a rapidly approaching Space Station. 
Below the viewport is a slot. The scooter's metre square steel hatch which 
governs life and death (in space, anyway) is currently closed.

You can see a toolbox (which is closed) here.

Monastery Chapel
You are standing in a monastery chapel. All around you, fellow Brothers of the 
Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into 
the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep 
concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.

>no
You are caught up in the collective chanting, and cannot break your 
concentration to do much of anything else.

Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.

"Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. 
Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of 
Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in 
turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us."

>n
You are caught up in the collective chanting, and cannot break your

Brother Joseph continues speaking.

"Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our 
order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that 
which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus 
-- we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, 
yet striving to maintain harmony."

Bathroom
It's midnight. There's blood everywhere because, hot diggety ding-dong damn, 
you just murdered someone with a plastic spork for trying to destroy the 
Universe. I mean, congratulations and all, but seriously, that's just...weird, 
man.The corpse of the man you most royally ensporked for trying to destroy the 
Universe with only his pinkie finger (he can do that, you know) is lying in 
front of you on the floor of the derelict, teal, horrible-smelling men's room. 
There's an entrance to the hallway of the abandoned community center that 
you're in to the South.

The murder weapon, the spork, is clutched in your trembling fist. Despite how 
much ass you kicked, you are slightly disturbed. You drop the spork on the 
floor of the bloody bathroom with a wet click in your disbelief as to how much 
ass you truly kicked.

"This is it!" he says as he dodges the last pothole and brings the truck to a 
stop. After twenty miles of the worst washboard road the country has to offer, 
you're just happy to have arrived.

You place your sandaled feet on solid ground and take a deep breath. The smells 
of autumn are at once sweet and earthy and full of the aroma of moisture and 
living things. A cool breeze blows in your face, soft and gentle. What a nice 
change, what a welcome relief from the tension and hustle of all you've left 
behind this weekend. It's just you and your husband, as he promised over a 
month ago.

You look around. What passes for the road you just traveled ends abruptly here. 
Over the last hour, bad asphalt gave way to gravel, which gave way, in turn, to 
the rutted two-track you see beside you. Ahead, the ruts continue, but it'll be 
on foot if you're to go any further. The old beater truck stands here, engine 
off but still ticking from the trip. Your husband closes the driver's door and 
comes around the rear to join you.

"How's my pretty lady?" he asks as he wraps his arms around you and places a 
kiss on your cheek from behind. "Tired, huh? Come on. Let's get the stuff. 
We'll be able to relax better once the tent's up."

He takes the two packs from the back of the truck and helps you into yours, 
then leads the way through the brush to the north. You roll up on the balls of 
your feet and give your pack a nudge, then pull the waist strap tight. Without 
looking back, you follow.

That was last night, and you hiked a short trail to a campsite off in the 
woods. Together you set up the tent, fixed a quick dinner, and fell asleep in 
each other's arms...

You wake with a start, something's missing, and you notice the sleeping bag is 
empty beside you. On his pillow is a handwritten note, which you collect. He 
must have crawled out early, as the sky is only now beginning to lighten.

You dress quickly, slip out of the tent, and follow the trail to the east.

Aspen Grove
You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all directions. 
Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin fingers, stroking the 
clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of gold rattle as the winds 
shift, and here and there one floats to the ground to join others that crackle 
underfoot when you move. A narrow path disappears east into the trees, and a 
camping area is visible through a small opening to the west. North is a wide 
meadow.

>I beg your pardon?

>Flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flop.

Meadow
You are in the middle of a large grassy meadow, bordered by aspens and a few 
white spruce in all directions. Pockets of morning fog squat in the damp and 
cold, hovering just above the ground and hiding from the sun that melts the 
hazy edge where they touch.

Another morning, another Minnow & Mommy class. It all started off normally 
enough, with nervous mothers holding up floatie-armed toddlers in the shallow 
end of the pool. Next came kicking, and bubble-blowing, and screaming... no, 
the screaming is where things started to go awry. Suddenly there was a mass 
exodus of minnows and mommies rushing past you to scramble up the pool steps, 
leaving you face to face with the monster that inspired such panic: a skunk, 
swimming slowly toward you from the deep end.

Clubhouse (in the pool)
The main feature of this large, high-ceilinged room is the pool, of course. 
Some chairs are arranged around its perimiter; the back wall is covered with 
items both decorative and functional.

There are two exits, one that opens east to the locker rooms and one to the 
west that heads directly outside. It is through this door that all the moms 
have fled -- you can see them now through the floor-to-ceiling windows on the 
south side of the building, clutching their minnows tightly and waiting to see 
what will happen next.

Swishing his tail from one side to the other, the skunk propels himself around 
the pool. [1]

Strict Z Test

According to the Z-Machine Standards Document, "objects are numbered 
consecucutively from 1 upward, with object number 0 being used to mean 
"nothing" (though there is formally no such object)." Hence, it seems 
reasonable that operations on object number 0 should either fail or, if that is 
not an option, do nothing. These tests are written with that assumption.

Please note that whenever a test is flagged as "correct", that only means that 
an instruction returned zero or non-zero (or branched / didn't branch) when it 
was supposed to. Not that it necessarily returned the correct value. If no 
result is written the result was not tested, and the test was only included to 
test the stability of the interpreter.

Your skin itches.

(press any key to continue.)You struggle toward wakefulness. This doesn't feel like waking up usually does, 
and the hard surface beneath you doesn't feel like your bed. You're woozy and 
nauseated, and there's an itchy prickling all over your skin. What happened? 
You'd been on a date with that guy from online, and then ... you don't 
remember.

You force your eyes into a squinting semblance of "open" and slowly sit up. 
This definitely isn't your apartment; the walls are a dull, sterile white and 
there's a huge window through which you can see the sun coming up --

Oh no. You've got to get out of here.

"Yes, master?"

You rush to your master's side and await his instructions. He is studying a 
fragile looking scroll and muttering to himself.

He looks up and says, "Ah, there you are. This ..." -- he hands you the scroll 
-- " ... goes back in the vault. I believe it is still open. And this little 
beastie ..." -- he hands you a small, empty brass cage -- "... goes back to my 
private quarters. Thank you, that will be all."

You bow, and head downstairs to the vault. The heavy stone door is wide open, 
and a golden key juts out of the lock.

Without warning, someone shoves you roughly from behind. The scroll and the 
brass cage fly out of your hands as you fall to the ground. There is a loud 
"click", and everything turns black.

Thank you for playing The King and the Crown, the first ever completed 
interactive fiction by Wes Lesley. This work of fiction was created to be 
submitted to IF comp 2015, and was written in one afternoon on Sunday July 
fifth, 2015. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had dreaming it up. 
Also, I have tried my best to make sure there are no annoyances when using 
text-to-speech while playing this game, however, I cannot be certain that 
everything will be translated smoothly into audio.

                                by Wes Lesley

                             first time playing?
                            the HELP is delicious

                      DENDERO - PALACE OF THE GOOD KING

         It will be a big day for you today. No, wait. It will be a long day 
for you today. Starting with getting your Crown out of the cabinet behind the 
throne and your Scepter from ... wherever it is you left it last night. You 
really should keep a better eye on it.

The commonfolk are already piling up to meet their beloved King. Well, I say 
'beloved' - I should say 'at least less despised than the ones across the 
border'. All in all you're doing an okay job. Too bad that your father just had 
to outdo his own father - who killed one dragon - by killing the rest of them. 
Now instead of questing for glory you're stuck arbitrating disputes about the 
truest plagues and scourges to haunt a nation as mighty as the Denderoan Empire 
- such as turnips.

With the Royal Coffee in one hand and the Royal Bunny Slippers on your feet, 
you arrive in your office. Well, 'office'. Just a fancy name for the room where 
you keep your chair. And 'chair' is just a fancy name fancy people use to say 'throne'
. Honestly. You'd almost think a throne was something special.

... Wait a minute.

Oh, nevermind. It's too early for this - besides! The peasants will be here 
soon. They're already flooding the gates of the courtyard. By Vacxll, there's 
got to be at least five hundred commoners outside! They'll be yapping your ear 
off all day... Some of them brought their dogs. Why did they bring their dogs?

Good luck, my King. I fear you may need it.

Throne Room
A big throne room north of the main hall, both right out of medieval fantasy, 
adorned by big red banners with the family crest on them and stained glass 
windows to the east, north and west. And a throne, of course. That's where you 
sit and it also blocks the view of the intricately detailed but slightly 
unsightly Royal Cabinet which stores the Royal Crown for Royal Safekeeping.

>... Giving me the silent treatment isn't going to further the story.

>You can't go that way.

>What do you want to take?

>

                               QUIT THE STORY?
                      Are you certain you wish to quit?
                       (unsaved progress will be lost)

PROLOGUE: BREAKTHROUGH

"Due to the circumstances and lack of developments in your project so far, your 
contract will be terminated, effective immediately."

That's what he said. Some stupid corporate moron sitting in his office, wearing 
a daft suit and DigiCorp Technologies tie. Years of work, dozens of failed 
experiments, all the effort, simply to be phased out by a bunch of stupid 
company directors. As you stand alone in your laboratory, thinking about what 
might have been, you feel desolate. If only the blasted machinery would work!

Laboratory
The lab is a complete shambles. Hurriedly stacked pieces of paper make your 
workbench in the centre of the room totally unrecognisable. Steps lead up to 
the rooftop, the lab storeroom is to the north, and the exit from the 
laboratory is to the south. In one corner of the lab is the result of what is 
in effect your entire life's work, the translocation machine.

>That was a rhetorical question.

The lights in the room flicker briefly.

>
Storeroom
The storeroom is not in the mess that the laboratory is, primarily due to the 
fact that it is almost completely empty, most of your things have already been 
taken away by DigiCorp officials, leaving a shelf on one wall as the major 
storage place inside the room.

A triangular picture frame hanging on one wall catches your attention for a 
reason you are unable to determine.

On the shelf are a small screwdriver and a short length of cable.

Welcome to the world of St Borogrund's School - a world of intrigue, mystery, 
deceit, and excruciatingly bad dinners. Above a scattering of ugly grey 
outbuildings, Borogrund's four-storey tower block rises to assault the eye in a 
bitter and largely futile attempt to get a second glance. 

The end of term looms, and with it the prospect of your school report. Your 
parents have made it very clear that the report must praise you as a talented 
and conscientious individual. Being none of the above - but ever loyal to your 
parents - you make it your quest to seek out the offending report and... amend 
it. 

Borogrund's isn't just a strange name. It's a strange place. Expect the 
unexpected. Predict the unpredictable. And for pity's sake, don't go into the 
staff room unprepared...

Form room
Sunlight filters into your form room, where you are obliged to register each 
morning and afternoon, and falls across the tables as though reluctant to get 
itself dusty on the linoleum floor. The school's budgetary concerns are 
manifested in the hard wooden chairs and scratched, worn desks which surround 
you. A doorway leads east.

You can see Johnny Pike's jacket here.

Hello!!!! You are William Tell in this: a game about William Tell. In this game 
you live in Swisserland, which is where the Switzes live. The Switzes love to 
ski and make cheese and clocks and bank accounts. You, William Tell, are a 
Swiss in my game about Swisserland. You live in Swisserland City, Swisserland, 
which is the capital of Swisserland. The year is 1307 AD and a really bad man 
is PRESIDENT of Swisserland. The PRESIDENT lives in a box on top of a flagpole 
in the center of Swisserland City which is the capital of Swisserland and 
everybody who sees the box has to salute the box and say, "HELLO! BOX!!!" and 
act very reverential because that is where the PRESIDENT lives. This is 
important because you, William Tell, do not like the PRESIDENT at all and you 
are going to refuse to salute the box because if you don't you won't get the 
OPTIMAL ENDING and you won't collect all 10,000 POINTS.

You, William Tell, live in the mountains of Swisserland in a BLUE hut. Today 
you come down from the mountains with WILLIAM TELL JUNIOR, your SON, who eats 
paint chips. 

It is a regular day in Swisserland City and you are with your SON. Little do 
the both of you know what fate has in store for you...!

Street St. in Swisserland City
This is Street St. which is the main and only street in Swisserland City. They 
only have one street so things don't get confusing. To the north is the center 
of Swisserland City, which is in the middle of the city. To the south are the 
north gates. There are merchants here selling lots of things and shouting a lot 
and waving their arms and jumping up and down, and a lot of people, and a jeep. 
Life in the big city sure is confusing!!!!!!

You say to your SON, "Hello, SON, stay close to me so you do not die." He 
stares at you blankly in response.

>

>no

Further down the street
The street is packed with people here, as well, and the people come in a 
variety of wild shapes and colors. Right here is a man flying around with a jet 
pack. Over in this end is a curious fellow with a baseball for a head. Just to 
your right you recognize the familiar face of Vermont the grape vendor, 
standing in front of her box upon which a myriad of grapes of many different 
sizes and colors is laid.

The street goes north, towards the town square, and south. To the east is the 
alley of instant death.

Vermont the grape merchant is here, trying to sell her quota of five grapes 
before she leaves.

Vermont hands you a plump purple grape and says "Please take this plump purple 
grape!"

Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you 
feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly 
nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your 
struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she 
pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the 
backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake 
up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and 
distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason 
and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy 
objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement 
seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows 
are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange 
sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced 
before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears 
close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear 
looking at it for very long.

You come to your senses slowly and stagger to your feet, still only half-awake, 
aware of something...unusual...different... 

A scabby old striped cat with a malignant gaze glares at you from beside the 
bed. Nothing unusual about that. You've grown accustomed to its face. It kind 
of makes your day begin. Sad to say.

No, it isn't the cat. It's the ticking. The sound of something ticking... 

Oh no! The cat's ticking.

Another day, another dollar! Life is good at the moment, the property market is 
booming. Still, it does have its down side; when showing those Mulluer 
Corporation executives around that old theatre dump, err, opportunity you must 
have left your pager down in the basement. Better hurry, you have to meet the 
others at the opera in an hour, and be careful. It wouldn't do to show up with 
your clothes all dirty.

Theatre Lobby
This room is a tribute to the now-faded glory of the theatre. The still-smiling 
faces of forgotten productions stare out from faded posters at you. An old 
grand staircase leads up, while the exit lies to the south. Small private doors 
lead northeast and northwest.

What do you want to do now?

That was a rhetorical question.

You there, you look depressed. How about I try to cheer you up, eh? Would you 
like to hear a story?

Well, I admit it isn't the cheeriest story, but it's an interesting one. As far 
as I can tell, it first appeared on an Internet imageboard years ago, but I 
guarantee you it's a true story. Some of the details are a bit sketchy, though, 
seeing as how it's been around for so long.

You'd like to hear it? Alright then. Here goes.

If you go into this one tiny, dingy one-story bar in Paris, and the right 
bartender is behind the counter that night, you might be able to see a very 
exclusive gallery show of the lost works of one Henri Beauchamp. But, to get 
in, you have to prove you're a devotee of the artist.

You sit down directly in front of the bartender. He asks you, in clear and 
perfect English, "What would you like to partake of this glorious night?"

You really expected more.

You expected to crawl through tunnels, to climb down pits, to barely escape 
with life. Instead you were met with a humdrum walk through a well-illuminated 
walkway and a canned speech on a half dozen types of stalactites. Next time 
you'll read the brochure with more attention... You didn't even have a chance 
to use your new flashlight and compass.

But wait... what's that opening by the exit?

Cave Exit
The excursion has ended, and you are standing by the end of a cave. The path 
back has been closed for security, and the only way to go is east and out... 
unless you count a narrow passage to the north.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
Okay.

>n

You squeeze through the crack. The guide looks back and shouts at you to stop, 
but a second too late... as you fall down the pit behind the crack.

You slide down the muddy pit past several rooms. It turns into a ramp, and 
finally a slide through the floor, which slows down as the mud goes thin. You 
stand up and try to clean some of the mud as you inspect your surroundings...

Christmas Eve! You tell Bob to go home early; tidy up a little, and lock up the 
office shortly after four. You look on the old brass plate, which still reads 
"Scrooge & Marley", probably for the last time.

After visiting the engravers to pick up your package, you spend a few hours 
simply walking the busy streets, soaking in the happy anticipation all around. 
Then a simple, but magnificent, dinner at Kettners and a gentle stroll home. 
Time for bed.

Courtyard
Not everyone is complimentary about this courtyard, or the house whose front 
door you now face. "A gloomy set of rooms" it has been called. But it has been 
your home these many years; it was the site, a decade past to this very day, of 
the great visions that changed your life forever. And so here you stay, and 
here you expect to end your days. The door is north.

>
I beg your pardon?

>no
That was a rhetorical question.

>n
(opening the door)
(unlocking the door)
As you push the door open and enter, you stop for a moment to look at the 
knocker. Who knows why, for you see it every day -- morning and evening, and it 
is unremarkable enough. But you can't forget how, on this very evening a decade 
ago, you saw it transformed into the very image of your late partner Jacob 
Marley: the first of the very strange and disconcerting events of that 
wonderfully disconcerting night.

So you glance at the knocker now, and you are shocked to see it, again, assume 
a once-familiar appearance. But this time the face is not Marley's, but almost 
your own, though one you have not seen for twenty, even thirty, years. It is 
the face of your brother, Mordecai.

Shivering slightly (whether from the cold, or the disconcerting behaviour of 
your door knocker, you could not say) you go through the door, light the candle 
that stands ready on the hall table, lock the door carefully behind you and 
climb the wide staircase to your chamber.

Bedroom
A leopard never quite changes its spots, and your bedroom is still plain by 
most standards, but that is how you like it. Nevertheless, you allow yourself a 
few hints of comfort if not luxury. The heavy green brocade curtains are 
closed. Your table has a few papers on it. Your bed is ready for you. The door, 
leading east, is closed.

You're in a circular room, with old, worn stones set into the wall.  Torches 
rest in brackets on the wall, lighting the area well enough for you to see.  A 
narrow corridor heads north, and that seems to be the only exit from here.

There's some sort of panel on the wall nearby.

Corridor
This is a north-south corridor.  Unfortunately, you're not safe here from the

There's a hole in the floor here.

You can also see a glass tube (which is closed) (in which is a piece of paper)

This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your 
final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and 
the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, 
make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry. 

However, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy 
car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head 
goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, 
unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's 
progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 
'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth 
staying awake to investigate further.

You awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little 
foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....

It is a very strange time and place you find yourself in.

Earth. North America. Early 1998.

From readily available information, and the pronounced fears of a few 
politicians and information technology leaders, it is obvious to you that 
things are about to fall apart. Yet the world at large seems blissfully 
ignorant. Most citizens pay little attention to history and are unfamiliar with 
how unusually blessed latter-20th-century North Americans have been. 

Peace. Prosperity. We live for entertainment, money, and immediate 
gratification. 

Most people seem unwilling to believe that the geniuses who've given us all the 
technology we take for granted could possibly have painted us all into a corner 
with the Year 2000 century change problem, also known as the "Millennium Bomb" 
or "Y2K". 

On the other hand, a small but rapidly growing percentage of people - mostly 
information workers with above-average intelligence - are already predicting 
the breakdown of banks, stock markets, aviation, public utilities, ... maybe 
even society itself. 

You are an employee of Biritzcom. It is early 1998. Since this is the demo 
version, there is a demo fairy flitting about your head, limiting your 
experimentation to 20 moves for each of Uh-Oh!'s 5 phases.

Look out!!! The last thing you remember before the darkness rushed up to claim 
you is your brother's startled cry. You managed to swerve around the shadowy 
figure that appeared in the roadway, but lost control as the car jumped the 
shoulder and plunged headlong into this tree.

Swiveling your battered head you survey the wreckage. You realize that you are 
alone: your kid brother must have gone off to get some help. As you pry 
yourself free of the steering wheel's embrace, you can't help but notice the 
pungent odor of gasoline as it leaks from the ruptured gas tank.

Just your luck. You were on your way to your Aunt Mabel's 100th birthday party 
when your car finally gave up the ghost. Not like it hasn't been trying to do 
that for weeks, but on a student budget a newer car was out of reach. Nothing 
to do but walk to the nearest town and see about other transportation.

By Your Car
You're standing on a stretch of road by your car. On the sides of the road is 
nothing but flat, dry ground and nothing to see at all to the horizon. The sign 
you passed a few miles back said it was about 10 miles to the nearest town, the 
name of which you've already forgotten. Seeing as it's even farther back to the 
previous town, the only way to go is forward to the east.

Curb detracts from the scenic value of the vicinity.

You can also see your car and a road sign here.

>I beg your pardon?

Curb gnaws hungrily on his own forepaw.

"Come fly with me from safe harbour to stranger shores.
Come now, as light thickens, and the crow makes wing to rookery wood. Tempests
    rise as great bloody hands, to tear down our safe, homely lives.
Come with me on dragon wings to wicked woods, where night's black agents to
    their preys do rouse."

You have travelled through a long-forgotten valley, cut deep into the 
Carpathian mountains. This is Transylvania, an ancient land of mystery and 
superstition. A freezing cold mist fills this bleak landscape. Swollen, 
wrath-filled clouds rumble ominously above hag-ridden magic and enchanted 
woods. The melancholy days are come. The saddest of the year, of wailing winds 
and naked woods. From somewhere deep in the forest, you hear the howling of the 
wolves.

[ Be not forgetful to entertain

It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five days since 
I closed the gate.

Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot appeared: 
when the first bloody cough ensued from the mouth of an urchin. To have allowed 
the sick sanctuary at Saint Cuthbert's would only have damned us as well.

But we were already damned.

The plague came. And now we suffer.

Six crisp chimes mark Vespers. Your heart flutters for a moment, and you place 
your head in your hands.

Your Bedroom
Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems smaller of 
late. With so many of your brothers gone, there has been little for you to do 
but wait. Wait for the spots to appear in this tiny, dark room. 

A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the west.

Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself up 
proudly.

Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself from this 
morning.

Your mind dissolves as it touches the pillow. Today has been a busy day, and 
tomorrow will probably be no differant. But your not thinking about that, 
because your mind has already dissolved.

Like liquid, your thoughts drip together, falling from mist and mildew. Soon a 
dream forms. A small lizard is dancing to bad jazz. He's on his hind legs, 
kicking like Russians must have kicked during the Cold War. After what seems 
like minutes, he turns to you. His tounge flickers like a dying candle. There 
are no sounds, yet his tounge's writhing and curls seem to talk. "I am the Toe. 
Tips nil like math ah tame kill in spit."  Then the tounge stretches over to 
your face and pokes your eyes. Blinded, your nostrils suddenly become 
extrasensory as the scent of burn engine oil streams in. Then your ears go into 
overdrive as a manic laughter surrounds your being. The scariest part, is your 
not so sure that it's not you laughing. You start running. Blindly.

Written for Exidy Sorceror by Joseph R. Power

Modified for Heath Microsoft BASIC by J. F. Stetson

Rewritten for Graham Nelson's Inform by Adam Biltcliffe with help from the 
folks on ifMUD.

Do you want to play in Classic mode, Normal mode, Statistician mode or 
Cartographer mode?

Classic mode is as close as possible to the original text, including typos and 
miscellaneous ugliness. If you're not on a nostalgia trip, normal mode contains 
less typos and presents a few things (such as the final game summary) in a 
slightly neater way. Statistician mode is similar to normal mode but uses the 
status line to display your attributes and equipment instead of printing them 
out at the start of each turn. Cartographer mode ('m'ap mode) uses the status 
line to display a map of the current dungeon level.

The other notable difference is in the coordinate systems. In the original 
game, the 'x' axis was the vertical axis, and the 'y' axis the horizontal. All 
the new versions use the normally-accepted axes. This change manifests itself 
only in the displaying of coordinates and in teleporting, so the only thing to 
bear in mind is that whichever mode you are playing in, you simply need to 
enter the coordinates when teleporting in the same order as they are printed.

out at the start of each turn. Cartographer mode ('m'ap mode) uses the status 
line to display a map of the current dungeon level.

The other notable difference is in the coordinate systems. In the original 
game, the 'x' axis was the vertical axis, and the 'y' axis the horizontal. All 
the new versions use the normally-accepted axes. This change manifests itself 
only in the displaying of coordinates and in teleporting, so the only thing to 
bear in mind is that whichever mode you are playing in, you simply need to 
enter the coordinates when teleporting in the same order as they are printed.

You pass the sentry watching the doorway to the Yi control room, hardly aware 
of his presence, and step inside, stopping before the owner of the familiar, 
frowning face just inside. Your escorts come to a halt behind you.

"Tolan," the tall, wiry woman says to you.

You steel yourself for the need to speak. "Cheryl," you reply. "Dig Leader 
Cheryl Thadafel. I knew you would have need of the greatest Mechanist in the 
galaxy. Again." The longest speech ever to cross these lips?

"Tolan, this is going to be on my terms, or not at all."

You turn your empty hands face-up. "Cheryl, this is important to me. It is the Yi-Lono-Mordel
. Whatever the restrictions, I cannot miss this opportunity."

"Especially if the restrictions required you be kept away from it. Enough. I 
don't have much else to work with here, do I?" As she dismisses the guards, you 
sweep your eyes about the room.

Again.

This time you will pull it off--regardless of Cheryl's desires.

Yi-Lono-Mordel Control Room
Most humans would probably find it the height of fashion, but this low 
ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and 
sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical 
window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A 
cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor.

Cheryl Thadafel stands here, watching you closely.

[Type "ABOUT" for special information about interacting with THE WEAPON.]

>no
Just use TALK or REPLY to engage in idle chitchat; for non-conversational 
communication, see the information in ABOUT.

>n
You can't go that way.

Cheryl says, "This is our chance to make a difference, Tolan. But only if we do 
it according to my rules. You're going to see what sort of information you can 
get displayed. As soon as you bring some Yi text up, you stop. You don't touch 
anything until I say it's ok to continue. Got it?"

>take
(Cheryl)
I don't suppose Cheryl would care for that.

Cheryl says, "As you asked, the guards will keep their distance so they won't 
disturb your concentration. It'll just be you and me. And, since I'm no 
mechanist, I've got this--just so I can keep tabs on you." She shows you a 
holographic reproduction of this room, hovering over a black base. "There are 
sensors for movement, electromagnetic radiation, and I don't know what else, 
all analyzing this room. This little display lets me monitor the activity 
everywhere in the room so I can see what you're up to. So don't think you'll 
get away with anything."

The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered away from 
it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's just that after 
weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend cook-out isn't the way 
to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is an appealing thought.

None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

Edge Of Meadow
The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer afternoon. A 
stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old wooden bridge stretches 
across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a scrubby hillside stretches upward.

The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are pleasantly far 
off to the west.

>e
The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.

Stream Bank
A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge which 
spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the east rises the 
flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight; two usable trails lead up 
around it, to the south and the northeast.

You catch a pair of dark eyes in the edge of your vision; then they are gone.

  --- Rudyard Kipling, "The Sergeant's Weddin'"]

"You are cordially invited to the wedding of Deborah and Malcolm at St Jude's 
Church, Westlowe at 2.30pm." And, scrawled in the corner in what looks like 
your ex-flatmate Malcolm's handwriting: "Don't forget the paracetamol!"

So far so bad. You're no lover of weddings with egotistical aunts and uncles 
and squealing, hyperactive kids, but you were prepared to put up with it to see 
your old college chum get hitched. Now, though, things have taken a turn for 
the worse with a phone call from a posh sounding woman. "I understand you're a 
friend of Malcolm's" stated the voice on the phone. "You must come over here at 
once, and try to sort out this mess...". So that's why you find yourself 
tearing down the motorway towards Westlowe and the mysterious D'Arcy manor...

Outside the front entrance
You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like it's 
straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern touches help 
tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar alarm next to the 
elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man above the main entrance. 
Immediately in front of the house is a gravel drive which acts as a car park, 
and a small road leads off to the south towards the main road. A slabbed path 
runs around both sides (east and west) of the house.

You can see a security guard here.

>no
Aw, don't be negative.

You can feel a few spots of rain on your face.

>n
The nasty looking security guard blocks your way with barely concealed glee. 
"Your name's not down, you're not coming in," he says, though you can't see a 
list anywhere. Maybe he was a bouncer in his last job.

Jace's Room (on the bed)
Sleek white walls surround your futuristic bedroom, which has been your abode 
for as long as you can remember. The room is disorganized enough that you 
nonetheless never know what's hiding in it. Your large bed with its rumpled 
sheets lies in the southwest corner, opposite a chest of drawers. A writing 
desk and a stool stand next to you, and a wastebasket lies nearby. A door leads 
north to a bathroom, and a western door leads to a hall.

The Shore
Sarah Winchester has forgotten being awake. It is night, or predawn morning,

The Story Begins...

     All of the townspeople are seated around the old oaken table at the 
mayor's house. Mayor Mielon sits at the head of the table with Sir Gunther IX 
at his right. You sit behind your master, Borthur the dwarven smith. All twelve 
residents of Windhall have attended the town meeting.
     You listen as Sir Gunther continues his boring oration.
     "...and I begged upon Our Blessed Lord myself that he would but spare us 
just time to better prepare our funds for his approval."
     "What funds?" laughs Denvil the wood elf. "We don't even have half of what 
the village owes in taxes."
     "Thou art such vestile pessilation, thy yonder fop!" spits Sir Gunther 
angrily. "Thou dost not even live within thy city limits."
     "Oh, quit your bawling, Gunther," jeers the jolly wood elf.
     "This is Sir Gunther IX, and thous shaltith addresseth me as such!"
     Your master, Borthur, lets out a little snore in his dozing. You give him 
a slight nudge, and he starts out of his sleep, nearly knocking his chair out 
from under him.
     "And you, yon thief," Sir Gunther continues accusingly. "I'd bet thee a 
fair gold piece thou art holding out on thy funds."
     Kytan, the town trader and well-known thief, glares from under the hood of 
his robe at the flustered knight.
     "I have given just as much as anyone else at this table. If I have more 
left over, that is simply because I am a much wiser businessman."
     Before Sir Gunther can launch himself into another personal assault, Mayor 
Mielon's wife, Idah, stands to address him.
     "Well, what happened, Sir Gunther? Did Lord Osrich give us more time or 
not?"
     "Our Lord said that we hast had enough time to get our affairs in order. 
We need the money in one week, or this town and land shall be forfeited 
forthright."
     "What are we to do?" cries Mayor Mielon.
     At this time the fighter Midknight leans forward into the light of the 
fire. "Perhaps we do not have enough wares amongst us to pay off the town's 
debt, but there is a way."
     "But what?" ask Baezil the baker and Creston the cleric at the same time.
     "Nostrophidius, do you remember the story of the dragon that used to live 
around here ages ago, gathering treasure in his secret den? What was his name?"
     The old wizard, Nostrophidius, leans forward at being addressed. He stares 
at the group for a few moments before answering.
     "Yes, the dragon..."
     Nostrophidius' step-daughter, Kaela, a young girl about your age, stares 
up at the old man from her spot on the floor near the fire, getting comfortable 
in anticipation of the inevitable story.
     "Two hundred years ago, before there even was a town of Windhall, there 
once roamed a great red dragon on these very lands. Kirizith was his name, and 
all who heard it were stricken with a deep fear in the pits of their stomachs. 
Pillaging nearby villages, he massed together hoards of treasure in his hidden 
lair. The dragon grew in age and in power. Many brave knights sought to do 
battle with the dragon, but all fell before his might. Then one day he simply 
disappeared. It happened, in fact, on the very same day this town was founded. 
Knights marched here and built these same walls in preparation to do battle 
with the beast, but the time never came. To this day neither the great dragon 
nor his treasure has ever been found."
     "Splendid!" exclaims Sir Gunther. "When shall I begin my search?"
     Creston and Baezil look at each other in exasperation. Borthur only snorts 
from behind his beard.
     "You, Sir Gunther?" asks Midknight delicately. "But, should the town be 
attacked while you are gone, who would be here to protect us? You are...much 
needed here."
     Sir Gunther muses this compliment over.
     "Mighty Midknight, thy words are spoken true. My quest doth not lie in the 
discovery of the great treasure, but rather in the safety of the very people 
around this table."
     This draws a chuckle out of Denvil, but Sir Gunther only glares at him.
     "But then who?" cries Mielon. "You, Midknight? You, Nostrophidius?"
     "No, not me," replies Midknight. "I've retired."
     "It won't be me, either," adds Nostrophidius. "I'm twenty years past my 
adventuring age."
     Borthur starts suddenly. You jump back as he rises.
     "What about my apprentice, Aerin? His apprenticeship in smithing has left 
him strong and able, and he has both youth and intelligence."
     Everyone turns to look at the old dwarf. Finally Mielon cuts in.
     "An excellent idea, Borthur. What a fit young lad for the job!"
     "But..." you stammer.
     "Yes, quite excellent," smiles Kytan.
     "But how do you expect him to find the treasure?" muses Idah. "He doesn't 
even have anything to dig it up with!"
     "Ah, I can fix that!" laughs Denvil, eager to help.
     He jumps from his chair and produces from one of the thousand pockets in 
his hugely oversized robes the oldest, most battered shovel you have ever seen, 
which he gleefully hands to you.
     "Well now, you're all set," smiles Mielon.
     Everyone wishes you good luck as the meeting breaks up. Borthur draws you 
aside.
     "Why?" you ask him. "Why me?"
     "Ah, don't worry about it, lad. I'm sure you'll make a fine hero."
     And with that he wanders out the door. Your gaze lingers on Kaela as she 
and Nostrophidius leave to head back to their tower, but Midknight slinks out 
of the shadows to stand in front of you, startling you back into reality. Some 
day you'll figure out how he does that.
     "Aerin, I wish you to visit me one night while on your quest. I may have 
something that will come in handy."
     You stammer out a compliance.
     "I live within the forest southeast of town. I'll be watching for you."
     And with that he turns and walks out the door. You race after him to ask 
him a question, but you find the street empty. Some day you'll figure out how 
he does that, too.

     Well, best to get started on your search...

Central Windhall
     You stand in the midst of the small city of Windhall. The road runs along 
north and south from here. To the west is Sir Gunther's small house, and to the 
east lies Baezil's Bakery. You can almost taste all the delicious pastries that 
Baezil bakes fresh every day.

>
Northern Windhall
     You stand on the northern edge of the city of Windhall. To the west is 
Creston's potion shop, which is more often than not bare of products, and to 
the north you can see the small confines of Kytan's shop and house. It seems to 
create a dark and gloomy mood in all who look at it, much like its owner. To 
the east the road ends abruptly on the outskirts of town. On the distant 
horizon lie the mires and wet marshes of the eastern swamplands.

In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy 
mountainscape. As the townsfolk joyously prepare for the coming winter 
solstice, a young girl living with her family in a humble hut at the outskirts 
of town gains no comfort in the festivities. Her closest companion, her younger 
brother Sander Bales, has fallen seriously ill with a fever and can barely lift 
his head from the bed upon which he lies. Young Gretchen could hardly have 
suspected that such circumstances would cause the fanciful events that were to 
occur upon this solstice eve.

this bedroom. A long dark drapery hangs down over a portion of the east wall.

The memo was something of a surprise. You'd featured rather heavily in the 
issue before, and had reasonably suspected that the editor wouldn't want to see 
hide nor hair of you for a while. However, summoned you have been.

The trouble with these meetings is, you'll never know where it'll lead; whether 
he'll ask you to write a few hundred words for a box-out, or to spend a day 
tramping round the London suburbs in search of the homes of C-list celebrities. 
Maybe it'll just be a straight commission. And if you're really blessed, he'll 
fall into the usual trap of rattling off so much information in the meeting 
that you'll only need to transcribe what you can remember. Such are the 
misdemeanours available to you when your boss is disturbingly well-informed and 
in love with the sound of his own voice.

Still, you've not much time. Best get your skates on, especially if the 
receptionist is in one of his difficult moods...

Utopia Technologies. Industrial giant, economic powerhouse, the world's 
greatest scientific superpower, and the organisation most responsible for 
eroding civil liberties and personal freedoms. They're an all-powerful 
capitalist megacorporation that you despise completely and utterly, yet you're 
perfectly willing to join their ranks.

The paperwork has been filed, and you're on the way to the California 
Archipelago in a transport shuttle. There's no turning back now. Tomorrow 
morning, you'll be a citizen of Utopia, based in the Arcology -- that 
overcrowded, polluting eyesore of gargantuan proportions. You'll be a mere 
immigrant worker at the bottom of the corporate ladder, but your stomach still 
churns at the thought. Your motives for going may be pure, but that doesn't 
make it easy.

The journey from China has been uneventful, giving you plenty of time to think 
of your upcoming mission, and the massive responsibility that's been placed on 
your slender shoulders.

Civilian Transport Shuttle
As opposed to say, a military or executive shuttle, which would have seats to 
make the trip comfortable and an in-flight holomovie to ease the tedium of a 
three hour flight from Shanghai. Instead, this is the basic civvie model -- 
you're densely packed in a titanium can with over fifty other Chinese 
immigrants. The cabin reeks of sweat but there is nowhere to go, and at this 
altitude, opening the viewing windows would be the queen of bad ideas.

You almost jerk with fright, and you probably would if it wasn't for your 
extensive training and field experience. None of the other passengers can hear

called Nanci. Only in China.

Some people love exploring caves, and some people get a sick thrill out of 
falling. But you're not one of them.

Since childhood you've had a fear of heights, depths, and quick trips in 
between; those dreams about endless drops into bottomless pits still haunt you, 
especially when you've had a bit to drink. You were also one of those kids who 
was CONVINCED that the boogeyman lurked under the basement steps, down there in 
the cold and clammy darkness. Nope, you are definitely NOT a fan of these two 
exotic pleasures of falling and darkness, which is why you're not thrilled 
about being thrown into a deep, forbidding shaft. If the fall lasts long enough 
maybe you'll get a chance to ponder what's at the bottom of it all, and what 
you left behind on the surface...

Press any key to continue > 

To be fair you HAVE plumbed these depths, though not in a very heroic way. 
You've done research and talked to people, mainly. When you devoted last week's 
editorial to exposing the shady dealings of New Jersey public officials, you 
thought you'd be given a promotion. Maybe the newspaper chain would bump you up 
to some big city assignment, get you away from the little Morristown rag you'd 
been working on for seven years.

Apparently, the one thing you DIDN'T find out in your research was that those 
public officials OWN the newspaper chain, and that they're even more ruthless 
and immoral than you'd thought. Now, after being dragged out of bed and dumped 
into the pit itself, it looks like that promotion is a long way off.

Press any key to continue > 

But what IS in this pit? You've read facts about it in geological surveys. 
You've heard all the local folklore about the mythical creatures lurking down 
there -- the Wumpus was probably the most colourful monster of the bunch -- and 
you know for a fact that the city's been dumping toxic waste into it for years. 
Leave it to a bunch of suburban fat-cats to arrange a billion-dollar 
waste-disposal contract, and then just hire some local thugs to dump the stuff 
into a hole under Morristown. Could that toxic junk be leaking into the city's 
water supply? Lots of people are speculating, but nobody has had the courage to 
actually go DOWN there to check it out.

Press any key to continue > 

Well, looks like you've been reluctantly nominated. If you survive the fall, 
you might get a chance to solve these mysteries...and maybe win a Pulitzer 
Prize to boot! You've been falling for a long time, and it's almost time to 
land...for better or for worse.

And hey, maybe that Wumpus thing is really friendly?

spreadsheet.  You don't want to be at this desk, where people seem to regard 
you as the lowest form of life.  You'd much rather be at home in your garden 
eating the flowers.  'Eating'...?

You slump forward over your keyboard...

~~~

You are seemingly trapped in a walled enclosure, surrounded by grotesque... 
figures.  That venus fly-trap looks like the number two. Over there is a juicy 
tuber in the shape of an eight, while several boulders, round like noughts, 
stare evilly from their whitened faces.  

Something else is wrong: you are seeing all this from ground level and you 
can't seem to stop moving....

[ yak shaving > noun (uncountable)
  (idiomatic) Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to 
overcome intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem.]

You are Steve Goodwin. You're a regular guy, young, successful, dynamic. 
Recently promoted to the post of junior marketing executive at the Funhouse 
Novelty Company, you're the one who comes up with all those zany items you can 
buy for a Dollar in the pages of Cosmic Comics.

But something is missing in your life. A nagging question gnaws at your soul, 
undermines your joy at your new-found success and interferes with the very 
business of living. But this is not a answer you can find in the pages of any 
book; for what you yearn to know is the very meaning of life itself!

But then you learned about a man, a guru of great wisdom, endowed with the 
miraculous supreme realisation who could teach you the secrets of the universe. 
A six hundred year old hermit living at the top of a mountain in a kingdom most 
right-thinking people assume to be a myth. A man known as the Dada Lama!

And this is why we find you now, after many months of journeying, of fruitless 
searching, beaten and battered by the uncaring elements, in this mysterious 
valley hidden deep within the mountains...

...the mystical valley of Shangri-La!

Yak Shaving for Kicks and Giggles!
A Philosophical Odyssey by J. J. Guest
Release 2 / Serial number 101127 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 
(Type "about" for credits and game information.)

Shangri-La
You weren't sure what to expect from the mystic valley of Shangri-La. You'd 
heard all the stories of course -- a land of mystery and matchless beauty where 
life is lived in tranquil wonder, beyond the grasp of a doomed world! That's 
what it said in the brochure, anyway...

What you weren't expecting was a caravan park. But there's no mistaking the 
large sign over the entrance: "Shangri-La Caravan Park welcomes the pure of 
soul -- 200 Spaces Available." Most of the spaces are empty.

Directly ahead is perhaps the loveliest mountain you have ever seen; an almost 
perfect cone of snow, it is as though a small child had dropped a Cornetto in 
the middle of the valley. A broad path leads north to the mountain, and on 
either side are narrow trails leading northeast and northwest.

>I beg your pardon?

>That was a rhetorical question.

>
Foot of the Mountain
Here, at the foot of the mountain you are at last fully able to appreciate its 
immense size. A rough, twisting path becomes a narrow traverse that zig-zags 
its way up the mountainside, its summit obscured by mist.

To the west is a pleasant looking meadow, whilst to the east are a scattering 
of caravans. Far away to the north the Valley is blocked by a sheer wall of 
ice; an enormous glacier!

You are Zegrothenus, a wizard of some renown, respected for many potions and 
infamous for a few magical items (but those were experiments in your youth!). 
It was a dark and stormy night when you learned that your wizard's license 
would not be automatically renewed this year; the new Council bylaw required 
all member wizards to invent one artifact every half-decade.

You demanded an explanation. They did not have you specifically in mind, the 
Council said -- the Council being Faluna, Galadel the Fiery, and Jokan -- but 
you knew better. Jokan never liked you ("Earth wizards reek," he had informed 
you three years ago to this day); Galadel considered potions to be strictly 
amateur; and Faluna, you should have known that half-elves would take break-ups 
hard. They sent you to your lab, and then those -- curse them! -- "wizards" 
magically sealed the exits! They set up a pouring potion, as if to mock you, to 
illustrate how much time you had left. They even said that such measures were 
required by your penchant for procrastination! The swine!

Moments trickled by as you considered your options. At last, you balled your 
hands into fists. Very well! You would escape the fastest way possible, by 
whipping up a potion to startle them all. THAT would show that smirking 
Council!

You look around your woefully understocked lab, every step reminding you of 
something else missing. Heaving a deep sigh, you find consolation only in your 
well-stocked library and extensive glassware collection. You will make a 
potion, but which one should you make? The question confounds you; all you can 
think of doing is paging through your formulary until inspiration strikes.      
                                 
                                       
                                 * * * * * * *

Some days you make the potion, but today the potion makes you -- or breaks you.

Laboratory (By the Table)
You are standing in the center of your laboratory, by the circular chest-level 
table that looks like the stump of a tree. On further inspection, however, the 
table reveals that it is comprised of finely-corrugated steel painted and 
shaped to mimic natural wood. The table sprouts upwards like a mushroom, with 
an oak vat crouching beneath its eaves and a ceramic black cover, that at one 
time slid back to allow access to the hollow core. Your glassware spans the 
surface, and a steel band just below the surface provides hooks for tools. 
Suspended from the ceiling horizontally in the center of a rusty chain, a low 
oil lamp provides a bright yellow-gold light.

In addition to all your glassware, the lab table holds: flask one, flask two, 
flask three, flask four, a lead tray and a mortar.

Eri sits on her haunches, right behind you, as if expecting something.

That accursed reddish potion floats in the air, frothy-white vapors escaping. 
Over three-fourths remains.

Eri pads after you.

Laboratory (By the Bookshelf)
You are by the bookshelf which fills the wall. On the left is a brass torchiere 
that sheds a yellow-gold light upon the room, and to the right is an ornate and 
correspondingly heavy, wrought-iron bookstand. The cave's twin exits lead east 
and west. You look across the massive bookshelf, its shelves buckling under the 
weight of all your books and your situation brings several to your immediate 
attention: your formulary, Frye's Alchemy Compendium for Every Wizard, and a 
book on the nature of reaction by your friend Rasmun. The remaining 
miscellaneous books barely register.

A thin groove about the length of your arm has been carved into the north wall 
a few feet above the bookshelf.

That accursed reddish potion floats in the air, frothy-white vapors escaping. 
Over three-fourths remains.

Sorry, your interpreter claims to support sound effects, but since it does not 
support timed input (needed for some of them), I'll not use them. You may try 
to activate sound effects later by giving the SOUND ON/OFF command, at your own 
risk (read below)

WARNING: this code makes use of Z-machine features (sound effects and keyboard 
interrupts) that, although explicitly specified in the Z-machine Standard 
Document V1.0, are not commonly used, and it is possible that your interpreter 
does not implement them correctly (in particular, it may hang).

It's certainly not your first visit to the museum, but for some reason or 
another you've never been able to see the room that simulates the control 
bridge of an alien spaceship, with its famous talking computer Zen. Once you 
went here with Graham; you stayed too long in the rooms on the ground floor, 
and soon it was closing time. And on your next visit Zen was off for 
maintenance!
Well, machines that can talk fluently and even understand what you say are 
quite common now, but for its days Zen was probably a remarkable artifact. 
Anyway, this afternoon your curiosity is going to be satisfied...

ZEN SPEAKS! (or 1999: A Quite Brief Space Odyssey)

This is a silly little demo illustrating:
- annoying background "music" using standard sound effects
- rudimentary text-to-speech (producing a horrible robot-like voice)
- a very primitive Eliza-style response system

Grammar Room 16
The main exhibit on the second floor: Room 16, south of the mezzanine. A 
Jeffreys Tube runs east into a Star Trek: The Next Generation room, while a 
hexagonal sliding door to the south blocks the entrance to the bridge of the 
spaceship "Liberator".

The room looks strangely unadorned, however. There were many exhibits on your 
previous visit. Oh, and there was also that spiteful little girl (what was her 
name? Cecilia? Carmen?), and that curious guy who misunderstood commands... 
both museum employees, not visitors. Maybe they're on vacation?

An exhibition leaflet has fallen to the floor.

What looks like a phone booth pedestal stands in a corner, under a poster

ZOMBIES - Yet another abuse of the Z-Machine
A nostalgic diversion by David Magnus Ledgard with a large portion

Release 1 / Serial number 990524 / Inform v6.15

>LOOK
Dead Storage
This is a storage room. It contains an incredible assemblage of discarded junk. 
Some of it is so old and mouldering that you can't be sure where one bit of 
junk stops and the next begins. It's piled to the ceiling on ancient, rotting 
pallets. A narrow path winds eastward through the junk.

>SEARCH JUNK
You find many worthless items of hardware, old discarded memos and papers, but 
nothing of any use or value. But wait...
What's that in the corner? A lesser adventurer may have passed this by but not 
you. It seems to be an old Commodore PET computer and looks like it just might 
work. Next to the computer are two tapes one with the word "Zombies" scrawled 
on it in Biro. The other one is labeled "Wrap". Behind the computer on the wall 
is a power outlet.

>EXAMINE COMPUTER
In computer years this computer is older than Noah's Ark, but in actual years 
it is a little over two decades old. It consists of a monochrome monitor, tape 
deck, keyboard (with lots of funny little symbols on the letter keys including 
hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs, and corners, sides and crosses to allow the 
user to draw boxes on the screen), on/off switch and power cable; all build 
into one convenient trapezoidal unit. Performance wise it uses an 8 Bit MOS 
6502 processor, has a whopping 4K of memory and the BASIC language on a built 
in ROM.

>PLUG POWER CABLE INTO POWER OUTLET
Done.

>TURN COMPUTER ON
You switch the computer on.
The screen lights up and the word "Ready." appears in bright green text with a 
flashing green cursor beneath it.

>PUT ZOMBIES TAPE IN TAPE DECK

>TYPE LOAD "ZOMBIES" AND PRESS PLAY ON TAPE DECK

The word "Loading" appears on the screen and the tape starts spinning.

Welcome to the worlds of Infocom's interactive fiction. This diskette contains 
both a Tutorial game and a Demonstration of Zork I (R).

The Tutorial is an introduction to the concept of interactive fiction. In it, 
you will be taken through a small sample scenario that will allow you to become 
comfortable with the way these games are played.

The Demonstration is the actual beginning of Zork I, up through your discovery 
of the main caverns of the Great Underground Empire.

Whenever the word "MORE" appears on your screen, you will need to hit the space 
bar to see the remainder of the text.

(Hit the RETURN key now to start the tutorial.)

Welcome to the Infocom's interactive fiction tutorial. These games represent 
the state-of-the-art in interactive computer gaming. In them YOU are the main 
character in a story in which the final outcome is determined solely by YOUR 
actions. We offer a full line of interactive stories in such genres as Mystery, 
Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Tales of Adventure. This is a tutorial 
introduction to Infocom's interactive fiction.
 
In what follows, text in parentheses (here is an example) is part of the 
tutorial and not part of the game itself. Infocom's games start with a 
description of your location within the story. At the end of the description 
comes the prompting character ">", which indicates that the game is waiting for 
you to decide what to do next. If you can't think of what to do, type HELP. Hit 
the RETURN key to see the opening of the Tutorial Game.no

Living Room
You are standing in the living room of a large house. The room is bare except 
for a small, square table in the center of the room.
An oak door to the east opens into a darkened area and a mahogany door to the 
south is closed.
Above the mahogany door is an old sign with some faded lettering.
A shiny brass lantern is sitting in the center of the table.

(In order to proceed you need some idea of your purpose in the story. In one 
fantasy game, for example, the goal is to obtain treasures; in a mystery game, 
the goal is to arrest the murderer. The goal of each game is usually presented 
in the game documentation. The goal for the Tutorial Game is:
 
To trap the prized butterfly that is in the room to the south of the living 
room.

Hit the RETURN key now to continue the tutorial.)take

(You indicate your desires within the game by typing English sentences. A good 
rule of thumb in determining the kinds of sentences that will be understood is 
to think of completing the following sentence: "I want to ... " The three dots 
stand for the words you will type in. You will often want to see the 
description of the place you're in: you can type "LOOK AROUND" or, simply, 
"LOOK" to do just that. Try that now at the prompt. Remember to end all of your 
typing by hitting the RETURN key.)

From:    Starfleet Command

Subject: War Warning

1. Approximately three (3) hours ago, warships of the Imperial Klingon Empire 
Navy crossed the border into Federation space. These vessels have destroyed all 
outposts and ships in their path and have not answered any hails.

2. Therefore, effective immediately, a state of war exists between the United 
Federation of Planets and the Imperial Klingon Empire.

3. As the Enterprise is the only vessel available in this portion of the 
galaxy, your orders are as follows:

4. Engage and destroy any and all Klingon vessels you encounter within your 
designated patrol zone. Long range sensor scans indicate a total of 23 Klingon 
battlecruisers in your area.

5. Starfleet Operations calculates that it will take approximately 29 days to 
mobilize our forces and begin sending reinforcements to the front. We need you 
to hold off the invading Klingon fleet until those reinforcements arrive.

6. Good luck and good hunting.

It has been a fierce battle, full of bold moves, daring attacks, surprising 
gambits and heroic sacrifices. Throughout this, you've remained at your 
starting point, patiently waiting for orders. But now that the metaphorical 
dust has settled and most pieces have been exchanged, it finally looks as if it 
is your turn. The White King and one of your Pawn colleagues have managed to 
nail the Black King with his back to the edge of the board, but they can't 
finish him off without help.

The White King calls you to action. It is time to make your move.

In the beginning, TerpEtude was written. That was release DRAFT-1.

   Release 2:
Accented-out test: Added ability to display characters in bold, underline, and 
fixed-width styles.
Accented-out test: Noted that >> and << are, in fact, tested correctly.
Given-text test: It's the game file's job to print the given text before it 
calls @read. Fixed test to do this.
Timed-string test: Changed test to do both "invisible" and "visible" interrupts 
(only one interrupt in three actually prints text.)

   Upcoming Test Features:
List of terminating characters
Fonts
Stream 3 nesting

Your interpreter claims to follow revision 1.0 of the Z-Spec.

Interpreter claims that colored text IS available.
Interpreter claims that emphasized (bold) text IS available.
Interpreter claims that italic (or underlined) text IS available.
Interpreter claims that fixed-width text IS available.
Interpreter claims that sound effects ARE NOT available.
Interpreter claims that timed input IS available.

Interpreter claims that "undo" IS available.

Interpreter claims that fixed-width text IS available.

Test of emphasized (bold) text.

Test of fixed-width text (using "@set_text_style 8").

Now we will try combining styles. The Z-Spec does not require interpreters to 
display combined styles, so the lines below may not have all the styles they 
say they do.

Test of bold, italic text.
Test of bold, reverse text.
Test of italic, reverse text.

This tests signed multiplication, division, and modulo operations. All these 
operations are supposed to be signed. (The Z-Spec 0.2 erroneously says they are 
unsigned; this is corrected in 0.99.)

I am assuming the convention that division always rounds towards zero (not 
towards negative infinity), and (A % B) always has the same sign as A. These 
conventions seem to be common among existing C/C++ compilers. The Infocom 
interpreters also follow these conventions. (But they are not guaranteed by the 
C and C++ standards. Those only require that (A/B)*B + (A%B) == A, for all A 
and all nonzero B.)

This displays all the accented characters (encoding values 155 to 223). You 
will have to inspect your interpreter's display to make sure they appear 
correctly.

For the record, an umlaut is two dots; an acute accent is the one that slants 
up to the right; a grave accent is the one that slants down to the right; a 
circumflex is a pointy hat; a tilde is a squiggly hat; a ring is a ring; a 
cedilla is the little hook that hangs down below the C. Thorn looks like a 
capital D whose vertical bar extends both up and down, and Eth looks like a D 
with a little cross-stroke.

NOTE: Inform 6.11 contradicts the Z-Spec 0.99 document, on the subject of the 
European angle-quotes (the ones that look like '>>' and '<<'). The Z-Spec says 
that the character '>>' is code 162, and '<<' is 163. However, Inform 6.11 
(following the Z-Spec 0.2) compiles '@>>' as 163, and '@<<' as 162. The 
concensus is that the Z-Spec 0.2 and Inform 6.11 are wrong, and Z-Spec 0.99 and 
later are correct.

Your interpreter claims (by its header bit) that it DOES support timed input.

When you begin this test, asterisks should appear at the rate of one per 
second. If they appear at the rate of one every ten seconds, your interpreter 
is using the incorrect timing rate caused by an old bug in ZIP. If an entire 
line of ten asterisks appears all at once every ten seconds, your interpreter 
is not properly flushing its buffer.

Hit "." to return to the main menu, or any other key to begin the test. Hit any 
key to stop the test while it is running.

TimedKey> 

The timing interrupt function was not called at all. Either your interpreter 
does not support timed input, or you terminated the test before one second 
elapsed. (Or your interpreter has the "slow" bug and you terminated the test 
before ten seconds elapsed.)

Your interpreter claims to support timed input. This aspect of your interpreter 
appears to behave WRONG.

Your interpreter claims (by its header bit) that it DOES support timed input.

When you begin this test, you should be able to enter a line of input in the 
usual fashion. Every three seconds, a line of text will appear. (If the lines 
appear at the rate of one every thirty seconds, your interpreter is using the 
incorrect timing rate caused by an old bug in ZIP.)

Interrupts actually are occuring once per second; every third interrupt prints 
a line of text, and the other two have no visible effect. After each line, your 
input should be redrawn so that you can continue typing and editing it.

Hit "." to return to the main menu, or any other key to begin the test. Type 
"." on a line by itself to stop the test.

TimedString> 
Beginning test...

TimedString> BC

You just typed "BC".

TimedString> .

You just typed ".".

The timing interrupt function was not called at all. Either your interpreter 
does not support timed input, or you terminated the test before one second 
elapsed. (Or your interpreter has the "slow" bug and you terminated the test 
before ten seconds elapsed.)

Your interpreter claims to support timed input. This aspect of your interpreter 
appears to behave WRONG.

> 12

This tests whether your interpreter supports being handed input by the game 
file. (For example, after a function key is hit in Beyond Zork, the command 
prompt appears with text already in place -- whatever text you had typed before 
you interrupted it with the function key.)

The command prompt below should appear with the word "Given" already visible 
after it. You should be able to type more characters, or go back and edit the 
given character as if you had typed them yourself.

If you see the word "Given" twice, your interpreter is printing the given 
characters, which it shouldn't (that's the responsibility of the game file.)

Preload> GivenHello
You just typed "Hello".

> 13

This tests the interpreter's ability to do single and multiple "undo" commands.

Your interpreter claims (by its header bit) that it DOES support undo.

Simulating first move...
Save succeeded.

Simulating second move...
Save succeeded.

Hit "." to abort this test, or any other key to try "undo".
SingleUndo> 

First undo...
Undo succeeded (undid second move).

Hit "." to abort this test, or any other key to try a second "undo". (In many 
interpreters, executing the second "undo" will return to exactly the same point 
as the first one. If this occurs, and you see this message a second time (or 
more), your interpreter only supports single-move undo.)
MultipleUndo> 

Second undo...
Undo succeeded (undid first move).

Your interpreter claims to support "undo", and it does. In fact, it supports 
multiple "undo". This aspect of your interpreter appears to behave according to 
spec.

> 14

This tests if you can read text which is displayed immediately before the 
program quits. (It is not clear whether this is covered by the Z-Spec. However, 
some games -- including some original Infocom games -- display important 
closing text and then immediately quit.)

Hit "." to return to the main menu, or any other key to print a line of text 
and then quit. If the line of text does not appear, or appears and vanishes too 
quickly to read, your interpreter will have trouble with those games.

ClosingText> 

This is a final line of text. Goodbye.
